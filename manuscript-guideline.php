					   <h3 title="Manuscript Guidelines"> Manuscript Guidelines </h3>
<h4>Manuscript Type</h4>
<p>Firstly, mention the manuscript type like: Research/Review/Case Report/Editorial, etc.</p>
<h4>Manuscript Title</h4>
<p>Manuscript title limit should not exceed 30 words. It should not contain abbreviations and the title should be a brief phrase which describes the contents present in the article.</p>
<h4>Author Details</h4>
<p>The details (full names and affiliations) of all the authors should be given in the manuscript.<br/>
Corresponding author details (Name, designation, Department, university, Live address with Telephone, Fax and Email address) should be provided in the manuscript.</p>
<h4>Instructions to be Followed</h4>
<ul class="ullist">
<li> A brief title describing, content of the image.</li>
<li> Images must be submitted in TIFF, PDF or PPT.</li>
<li> The description regarding the image must be limited (250 words).</li>
<li> Images should be captured at the following minimum resolutions: halftones and color (all color must be RGB) 100-200 dpi; combination halftones 350 dpi; line art 500 dpi to match the journal criteria.</li>
<li> Citations/References (URL) should be mentioned properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Presentation</h4>
<p>Presentation is a means of communication that helps a person to disclose his work under a broad spectrum of clinical and medical sciences. Presentations are of three types: Power Point Presentation, Flow Chart and Poster presentation.</p>
<h4 style="font-size:22px;">Figures and Tables</h4><br/>
<h4>1. Image Submission</h4>
<p>Images with high resolutions must be submitted by the author. Authors should take full responsibility for copyrighted images during submission and publication process. Clinical and Medical Imaging is an open access journal publishing research/original submissions, reviews, brief reports, case studies, rapid communications, letters to the editor etc. related to basic, experimental and clinical aspects of research.</p>
<p>Suggested formats for figures should be in bitmap formats (JPEG, GIF, TIFF, etc.). Please send us the Photoshop indexes, in case the pictures need any differential segments on distinctive layers.</p>
<h4>2. Figure Legends</h4>
<p>Use numerical to designate figures (e.g., Figure 1). Use justifiable description, if necessary</p>
<h4>3. Figure Quality</h4>
<p>During submissions, figures are supposed to be at sufficient quality, preferably as JPEGs</p>
<h4>4. Tables</h4>
<p>Tables can be included in the text, if not submitted as a separate file, oriented in portrait form (not landscape) and upright on the page, not sideways</p>
<h4>5. Table Legends</h4>
<p>Use numerical to designate tables (e.g., Table 1). Use justifiable description, if necessary</p>
<h4>6. Equations as Graphics</h4>
<p>If equations cannot be encoded in MathML, submit them in TIFF or EPS format as discrete files (i.e., a file containing only the data for one equation). Only when tables cannot be encoded as XML/SGML can they be submitted as graphics. If this method is used, it is critical that the font size in all equations and tables is consistent and legible throughout all submissions<br/>
Suggested Equation Extraction Method<br/>
Table Specifications<br/>
Equation Specifications<br/>
Supplementary Information<br/>
Discrete items of the Supplementary Information (Materials & Methods, Figures, Tables, etc.,) referred to at an appropriate point in the main text of the chapter. Summary diagram/figure included as part of the Supplementary Information (optional). All Supplementary Information is supplied as a single PDF file, where possible. File size within the permitted limits for Supplementary Information. Images should be a maximum size of 640 x 480 pixels (9 x 6.8 inches at 72 pixels per inch).</p>
<h4 style="margin-bottom:15px;font-size:22px;">Manuscript Processing</h4>
<b style="text-align:left;">1. Plagiarism</b>
<p>Plagiarism is copying another person’s text or ideas and passing the copied material as your own work. You must both delineate (i.e., separate and identify) the copied text from your text and give credit to (i.e., cite the source) the source of the copied text to avoid accusations of plagiarism. Plagiarism is considered fraud and has potentially harsh consequences including loss of job, loss of reputation, and the assignation of reduced or failing grade in a course”.</p>
<p>All manuscripts received towards our journals are scanned for plagiarism. If potential plagiarism is detected, authors will be contacted for clarification. The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others, it is necessary to indicate the source of the information within your paper using an internal citation.</p>
<h4>2. Peer Review</h4>
<p>The practice of peer review is to ensure that only good science is published. It is an objective process at the heart of good scholarly publishing and is carried out by all reputable scientific journals. Our referees play a vital role in maintaining the high standards Transport Policy and all manuscripts are peer reviewed following the procedure outlined below</p>
