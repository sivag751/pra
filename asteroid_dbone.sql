Although there are many advanced treatments, some types of breast cancer are refractory to therapy. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy has been regarded as an effective way that can be used throughout the cancer treatment process, which including topoisomerase inhibitors such as doxorubicin. Topoisomerase enzymes play a specific role in changing of DNA topology, which are the premise of DNA replication, transcription and repair. Topoisomerase inhibition researches are increasing, because topoisomerase inhibitors have a good targeting effect on rapidly proliferating tumor cells, and are not depend on hormone receptors in breast cancer cells. Since the difference between catalytic inhibition and poisons, the mechanism of topoisomerase inhibitors are not unique, but the path of cell death after DNA damage is roughly the same. Recent years, intensive efforts were devoted to explore the mechanism on resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors. In order to reverse resistance, topoisomerase inhibitors can also exert anti-tumor effects in conjunction with other anti-cancer drugs, such as olaparib (PARP inhibitor). This review presents biology and molecular mechanics of the topoisomerase enzymes, and the effects of their inhibition in breast cancer, are discussed to explain and support the application of topoisomerase inhibitors in breast cancer.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Breast Cancer, Resistance, Topoisomerase, Topoisomerase Inhibition</p>', '<p>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women [1]. According to a survey conducted in 2018 [2], the incidence of breast cancer is the highest, and the mortality rate is the second among women in the United States. Similarly, breast cancer mortality among women in Asia is increasing every year [3]. Collectively, breast cancer still remains a life-threatening malignant disease. The regimens are related to the classification of diseases. The main treatments in breast cancer methods include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy and gene-targeted therapy [4]. Treatments for early breast cancer, with cytotoxic drugs, have a better outcomes such as minimized surgical management [5]. DNA topoisomerase inhibitors play a basic role in treatment programs not only for those who did not participate anthracycline or taxane chemotherapy, but in neoadjuvant for many kinds of breast cancer [6].</p>\r\n<p>With the development of modern pharmacology, we know the relationship between topoisomerase and cancer. The topological configuration of DNA in cells can keep the stability of genetic material, but it is also the biggest obstacle to DNA activity. DNA topoisomerases exist in all biological cells which can break single or double strands of the DNA to release the tension caused by entanglement, so that the cell life activities can continue [7]. Therefore, DNA topoisomerases play important roles in DNA replication, repair, cell proliferation and other cell processes [8]. DNA topoisomerase inhibitors have been used as chemotherapy drugs for malignant tumors with remarkable clinical effect, especially in breast cancer. The studies on DNA topoisomerases have increasingly gained attention. This review summarizes the results of topoisomerase enzymes study and the effect of their inhibitors in breast cancer.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Structure and Function of Topoisomerases</h3>\r\n<p>Advancing replication forks cause double-strand DNA strain, leading to gene expression errors, chromatin rupture, mitosis failure, eventually cell death [9]. The main function of DNA topoisomerase is to regulate the topological structure of DNA which can reduce the tension generated by both positive and negative DNA superhelix, and enable the normal process of DNA to replicate, transcript and repair [10,11]. According to the mechanism of DNA topoisomerase and structural characteristics, it can be divided into two main categories: type I topoisomerase and type II topoisomerase [12].</p>\r\n<p>Type I topoisomerase (Topo I) belongs to the monomer enzyme, including the Topo IA, Topo IB and Topo IC [13]. There are four domains: amino-terminal domain, core domain, linker domain and carboxy-terminal domain [14]. The concentration level of Topo I is stable in mammal cells [15]. Among the multiple active sites in Topo I, Arg488, Arg590, His632 and Tyr723 are the four active sites that are well-defined in the study. Except Tyr723 is located in the carboxy-terminal domain, the other three are located in the core domain of Topo I. In the catalytic process of the enzyme, Tyr723 covalently binds to the 3&rsquo; phosphate end of the DNA single-strand break.</p>\r\n<p>Type II topoisomerase (Topo II) is a dimer enzyme ranging from 160-180kDa that causes DNA double-strand broken [10,16]. Topo II can be divided into three domains: N-terminal domain, the central domain of the enzyme and C-terminal domain [17]. The central domain contains the active site, tyrosine 782 residue, which forms the covalent bound to DNA [18]. The dimer consists of two subtypes, Topo II&alpha; and Topo II&beta;, whose physiological functions are quite different: Topo II&alpha; can release the tension generated by positively supercoiled DNA. The concentration of Topo II&alpha; is highly expressed in cell growth phase and is associated with cell proliferation; Topo II&beta; is similar to Topo I, which can release positive and negative supercoiled DNA; Topo II&beta; is expressed stably in cells, but has no direct relationship with cell cycle [19,20]. Moreover, Topo II&beta; cannot compensate for the loss of Topo II&alpha; in mammalian cells, which means two isoforms have different roles in cells [21,22].</p>\r\n<p>The Topo I inhibitors used in clinical practice are mostly water-soluble derivatives of camptothecin, and the Topo II inhibitors with better effect are podophyllotoxin derivatives, such as etoposide. The structure and activity of topoisomerase targeting agents are shown in Table 1.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Mechanism of Topoisomerases</h3>\r\n<p>Topo I first recognizes and binds to a specific DNA sequence. Topo I breaks one strand of DNA in the absence of energy [30]. Tyrosine in Topo I attacks DNA phosphodiester bond in one strand of DNA by nucleophilic way, then tyrosine in Topo I binds covalently to the 3&rsquo; phosphate of one DNA strand, and the 5&rsquo; end forms a hydroxyl group. In this way to form the topo I-DNA covalent complex (Topo I cc). Because the tension of the DNA drives the helix to unwind in the direction of reducing tension, the broken single strand with the end of the 5&rsquo; hydroxyl group is rotated around another complete single strand, untying the positive or negative superhelix. After changing the topology of DNA, Topo I is released from DNA [7]. The nickle DNA single strand is rejoined under the action of repair proteins such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), then the DNA is restored intact and subsequent life activities continued [31]. The specific process is shown in Figure 1.</p>\r\n<p>There are two closely related isoforms of topoisomerase II in mammalian cells, one is Topo II&alpha; (170 kDa form), and the other is Topo II&beta; (180 kDa form) [32]. Biochemical and function of Topo II indicate that this enzyme is essential in the segregation of newly replicated pairs of intertwined chromosomes, which highly associated with mitosis [33]. Topo II creates a DNA double-strand broken with the participation of two ATP molecules and divalent metal ions to form the gate of DNA. A complete DNA duplex near the gate passing through this gap for increasing or decreasing the linking numbers of the DNA rings [34]. After the complete DNA double-strand is passed, the dimer undergoes a certain configuration change, and the separated DNA ends 5\', 3\' are re-ligated. Then, the formed gate of DNA structure is closed and DNA recovery integrity [35] (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Topoisomerases Inhibition</h3>\r\n<p>DNA topoisomerase inhibitors are used as chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinical treatment of tumors. In general, their inhibition function referred to two categories: catalytic inhibition mechanism and poison mechanism [26,36].</p>\r\n<p>Catalytic inhibition means that they can directly affect topoisomerase enzymes, for example, interferencing the action of the enzyme or disrupting the enzyme. Topo II catalytic inhibitors can be used in various steps of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The main reaction mechanisms are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>(a) The compounds inhibit the catalytic function and change the conformation of the enzyme, so that the Topo II enzyme cannot relax the DNA supercoil, which result that condensation of mitotic chromosomes is increasing, such as aclarubicin.</li>\r\n    <li>(b) Compounds that stabilize noncovalent DNA-Topo II complex to stop DNA re-ligate, which results are same with aclarubicin, such as ICRF-187.</li>\r\n    <li>(c) Other compounds can inhibit ATP binding, such as novobiocin [36,37].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In order to blocking DNA recovery, poisons can be linked to the DNA-Topo cleavage complex to form ternary complexes. Topo poisons stabilize DNA fragments in cell cycle process, increasing the concentration of the cleavage complex. The fragments of DNA could activate the apoptotic pathway to kill the cells [38]. Drug-DNA-topo ternary complexes are not always to cause cytotoxicity results (cell death) directly. As for Topo II poisons (anthracyclines in particular), they can inhibit the DNA repair way, then active the cell death pathway [39,40]. Allan Chen, et al. [41] demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of poisons are highly related to DNA synthesis, so that they can arrest cancer cells in S phase and inhibitors can work at low concentration to topoisomerase in S phase. This finding demonstrates that topoisomerase inhibitors working depend on topoisomerase protein concentration.</p>\r\n<p>Studies in Topo I have shown that Topo I agents, DNA and Topo I protein formed a complex by itself is not fatal, but collision with the replication forks or transcription complex will cause cell death [42]. If the cell cycle checkpoint kinase detects DNA nicks before the collision, the cells will be arrested in G2/M phase. However, if not repaired in time, the cells will die [43]. In the molecular model, the Topo I-DNA covalent complex (Topo Icc) is transiently present [44]. Under normal conditions, the complex acts as intermediate in the DNA re-connection process, and the concentration is within a certain range in nucleus [15]. When the Topo I inhibitor is inserted into the base pair of the Topo I cleavage complex, there are certain requirements for the site of the ligation with drugs:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>(a) &pi;-&pi; connecting with the DNA nicks.</li>\r\n    <li>(b) hydrogen bonds formed in Topo I amino acid residues [45].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In Camptothecin (CPT), three hydrogen bonds are formed between camptothecin residues 1,17and 20 and amino acid residues Arg364, Asn722, and Asp533 respectively [46]. Noticeably, mutations in other amino acid sites of Topo I do not prevent Topo I agents from attaching to DNA covalent complex [45]. However, if there were changes in connected sites of Topo I protein, these will cause CPT to fail to connect with drug and lead to high resistance to CPT. Topo I from CPT-producing plants have 4 amino acid substitutions in the positions that are proposed to influence CPT binding: Ile-420 to Val, Asn-421 to Lys, Leu-530 to Ile and Asn-722 to Ser. Recently, it was found that Asn722Ser in human tumor cells has changed which caused CPT resistance [47].</p>\r\n<p>The mechanism of action of Topo II poison is divided into two types: one group of poisons are traditional, interfacial, noncovalent, and redox-independent [17,22,48,49]. These chemicals form noncovalent with Topo II protein interface in the vicinity of the active site tyrosine [22]. The other group of poisons are covalent to Topo II amino acid residues and require redox activity to against Topo II [22,48]. Both of two mechanisms can enhance the DNA cleavage. But the letter group can abrogate the Topo II poisons activity by reducing agents and delay DNA recovery that can not affect compounds in former group [50,51]. Topo II poisons decrease DNA re-ligation rate, increase intracellular DNA broken and chromatin irregular recombination. When these poisons cause permanent DNA breaks in sufficient concentration, they can trigger death pathways [22,52].</p>\r\n<p>Actually, Topo II inhibitors are the most effective anticancer drugs but often cause serious side effects, such as secondary malignancies [53,54]. Some studies found that the drawbacks of targeting Topo II&beta; include the induction of cardiotoxicity and the potential development of secondary malignancies, such as doxorubicin [28,55]. Therefore, inhibitors that target Topo II&alpha; will have a better effect in chemotherapy [56].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Topoisomerase Inhibition and Breast Cancer</h3>\r\n<p>According to website, type of breast cancer can be divided into invasive and non-invasive breast cancers [4]. Early studies identified two types of Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive breast cancer subtypes by using cDNA microarray technology: ductal A and B breast cancers, which have highly response to treatment [57]. As for ER-negative patients, they can be divided into three groups: HER-2 high expression type, basal type, and normal type. Compared with ER-positive breast cancer, these three subtypes have poor response to treatment and poor prognosis [58]. Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) defined by Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity is a group with poor prognosis, refractory to therapy, and become a major problem in the treatment of breast cancer [59]. Topoisomerase inhibitors as cytotoxic drugs plays a certain roles in treatment. On the one hand, Topo I inhibitors can exert anti-tumor effects in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, such as olaparib (PARP inhibitor) [60]. On the other hand, there exist a positive correlation between Topo II&alpha; expression levels and pathological grades of breast cancer. Topo II&alpha; expression is up-regulated in breast cancer cells [61,62]. So Topo II inhibitors could exert anti-tumor effects. Due to expression of Topo II&alpha;, anthracyclines may be effective in treatment of TNBC [59].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Topo I Inhibitors and Breast Cancer</h3>\r\n<p>As the mechanism of Topo I inhibitors, they stabilize the Topo I-DNA cleavage complex, and DNA single strand broken in the complex can become DNA double-strand broken near the advancing replication fork, which is the main cause of cell death [63,64]. Topo I inhibitors are not frequently used as a monotherapy in clinical, and they are not interfere with anti-metabolites drugs either [65]. Iben K&uuml;mler and colleges have investigated and reviewed the use of Topo I inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer, and they concluded: Irinotecan seem to be effective in some patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes [66]. However, Topo I inhibitors have certain Adverse Events (AE), such as neutropenia, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting [67]. Some studies have suggested that following biomarkers to select which patients are sensitive to Topo I inhibitors can increasing effect of Topo I inhibitors in individualized treatments [60,68]. These biomarkers are mainly involved in DNA repair functions such as PTEN, Chk I, TDP I, PARP, BRCA I, P53, WRN protein, and Topo I gene copy numbers (Table 2).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Topo&alpha; Inhibitors and Breast Cancer</h3>\r\n<p>The peak concentration of Topo II is in G2/M phase, which means that Topo II is connected with proliferation cells [69]. Cells that express high levels of the enzymes are sensitive to Topo II poisons, and the decrease of Topo II inhibitors activity contributes to the drug resistance [17,70]. There are many researches about Topo II and breast cancer [71-73]. Topo II&alpha; is overexpression in Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR) negative and vimentin positive breast cancer [61]. Vimentin is a protein that has relationship with invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. In addition, high level of Topo II&alpha; is correlated with the high expression of the proliferation markers Ki67, RacGAPI and c-Myc [73,74]. But why is Topo II inhibitors more effective in ER-negative breast cancer, only for levels of Topo II protein? What is the correlation mechanism between Topo II and cancer-promoting genes? As highlighted by Qi, et al. [75] that Topo II drugs can active p38&gamma; specifically in intrinsically sensitive cells leads to phosphorylation and stabilization of Topo II&alpha;, promoting the action of drugs to inhibit cell proliferation eventually. However, p38&gamma; lose activity in ER-positive breast cancer cells. It has long been recognized that p38&gamma; is belonged to p38/MAPK pathway, and their experiments also indicate that Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity is up-regulated by treatment of breast cancer with Topo II drugs. Besides this, rare signal pathway be found to clarify the regulator mechanism about Topo II drugs and breast cancer types so far. There is an analysis from multiple advanced breast cancer clinical trials established that monotherapy with mitoxantrone achieved an overall response rate of approximately 33% in patients with no prior exposure to chemotherapy [76,77]. Generally, targeted therapies in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) have no effect. If there is high expression of Topo II&alpha;, the anthracycline anticancer drug can be used as a viable chemotherapy proposal. Some studies have shown that mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of families with hereditary susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer [78]. In this population with breast cancer, Topo II mediated Double-Strand Broken (DSB) is more sensitive than other cells, and therefore etoposide has better results [79]. In summary, monotherapy with Topo II inhibitors can get therapeutic effects for breast cancer.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Resistance to Topoisomerase Inhibitors</h3>\r\n<p>Resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors may result from many processes. We can summarize several reasons as follows. From Topo I inhibitors aspect, resistance maybe from:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>(a) Concentration of drugs are insufficiently in tumor tissues.</li>\r\n    <li>(b) The drug exclusion rate is increasingly.</li>\r\n    <li>(c) Mutation of Topo I causes connection failure with drugs.</li>\r\n    <li>(d) Altered signaling triggered by the drug-DNA-Topo I complex.</li>\r\n    <li>(e) Overexpression of DNA repair protein and degradation of Topo I [80].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As for Topo II inhibitors, resistance involved in Topo II activity which including:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>(a) Decreasing Topo II activity;</li>\r\n    <li>(b) Mutation in Topo II encoding genes [70].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Tumors are sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors in initial treatment, but acquire resistance eventually. In the research of acquired resistance of mammary tumors to the Topo I inhibitors, Serge Zander AL, et al. illustrated that topotecan resistance can be delayed in Abcg2-/- tumors, and overexpress of ABCG2 is related to camptothecin/topotecan resistance [81,82]. The drug efflux transporters ABCG2 has been reported as a crucial factor in resistance of various tumor types [83,84]. During the therapy of topoisomerase inhibitors, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is not effective in resistance. P-gp leading to resistance may work with other weak resistance mechanisms [81].</p>\r\n<p>Nowadays, on the one hand, there are many effective topoisomerase inhibitors under preclinical studies. Indenoisoquinoline agents which belong to non-camptothecin Topo I inhibitors are chemically stable and are not as substrates for the ABCG2 transporters that related to resistance of topotecan [43,85]. As a kind of promise direction, targeting Topo II&alpha; compounds continue to be isolated from etoposide-related nature products [86]. Wang Chen, et al. [56] demonstrated that design and synthesis podophyllotoxin derivatives have good prospects. Nevertheless, betulinic acid which from plant sources has multiple molecular targets in breast cancer, including function of topoisomerase inhibition [87]. On the other hand, researchers can repress some overexpression factors, such as DFF40 [88], phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase [89], substance P [90]. Perhaps we can select another compound as a topoisomerase inhibitor sensitizer to overcome resistance. It is effective in combination of PARP inhibitor and topoisomerase inhibitor [91]. A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor TMU-35435 can enhance etoposide cytotoxicity in triple-negative breast cancer [92]. In the way of sensitization, topoisomerase drugs can work at a lower dose and minimized side effects.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>DNA topoisomerases are widely presented in mammalian cells. Topoisomerases in cancer cells can efficiently unwind DNA and make cells proliferation rapidly. Breast cancer is an aggressive disease that affects a large number of patients and families every year. Chemotherapy plays an important role in most types of breast cancer. As for high level of topoisomerase I and &alpha; in breast cancer, targeting topoisomerase is recognized as effective regimens and always be used in combination with other basic chemotherapy drugs, even target drugs, such as taxanes, gefitinib. Generally, many patients treated with chemotherapies develop drug resistance, therefore, it is pivotal to find effective sensitization methods and detect new topoisomerase inhibitors. Nowadays, there are many continuing researches in molecular targets promoted the development of breast cancer drugs, which could enhance the power of topoisomerase inhibitors, for example, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) receptors, protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, PI3K/Akt signal pathway, microRNAs (miRs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [93]. However, it is still a problem that how to connect topoisomerases work with those molecular targets. Actually, many topoisomerase inhibitors not only affect protein itself, but cause changes of other genes and protein function. If those changed molecules can enhance the effect of drugs, can we think those kinds of cell lines or cancer are sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, or they could become targets to reverse topoisomerase inhibitors resistance, such as p38&gamma; [75]. All much we want are to control the disease and improve the quality of life for patients. This review as a summary of the topoisomerase mechanisms and their inhibitors in breast cancer treatment to provide a reference for future research. It is our hope that these potential biomarkers mechanism works and signal transduction pathways about topoisomerase enzymes could be getting clearer.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31184787\" target=\"_blank\">Miller KD, &nbsp;Nogueira L,&nbsp;Mariotto AB,&nbsp;Rowland JH,&nbsp;Yabroff KR, et al.

The study included a total of 176 subjects suffering from AC and 131 normal control subjects in Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Chongqing  Medical University (Chongqing, China) from July 2015 to July 2017. There was no significant difference in age between the two groups. We found the morbidity of allergic conjunctivitis  was higher in male than in female of children (P&lt;0.01). And our research showed that a small number of children in the case group were ever breast-fed and the percentage was far less  than the control group (P&lt;0.01). A further study found that the rate of parental allergy history in the case group was higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.01 both in father and  mother).

Usually it responds to topical steroids, but sometimes this treatment is ineffective.</p>\r\n<p>Aim of this clinical research is to introduce a new therapeutic method to treat the Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS) with Platelet Rich Plasma with a resolution of the symptoms.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus; Platelet rich Plasma; Lichen sclerosus; Genital area; Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, inflammatory, lymphocyte-mediated disease that usually involves the mucosae (oral mucosae and anogenital area). It is characterized by ivory-white  plaques, &ldquo;cigarette paper&rdquo; such as epidermal atrophy.</p>\r\n<p>Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS) has two peak ages of presentation, prepubescent girls and postmenopausal women (mean age of onset is in the fifth or sixth decade), but it is most  commonly present in peri- or post-menopausal women [1].</p>\r\n<p>Women complain of intractable pruritus (worse at night), irritation, soreness, dyspareunia, dysuria, and urinary or faecal incontinence. Nine percent of cases may be asymptomatic.  (VLS) may remain unknown for years, affecting the quality of life [1-3]. In the late stage it is also associated with an increase of the risk of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.  The diagnosis is made clinically, in most cases, and early treatment may reduce or prevent the risk of scarring.</p>\r\n<p>Local hygiene measures and use of emollients is essential. Currently ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are the medical treatment of choice. The therapeutic response is often  unsatisfactory and therapeutic alternatives are needed. The following measures have been tried: ospemifene, topical calcineurin inhibitors, UVA1 phototherapy, topical tretinoin,  oral acitretin, oral cyclosporine, cryotherapy, CO<sub>2</sub> laser, ultrasonic therapy and surgery. No clinical benefit has been proven with topical administration of progesterone  and testosterone [4-8].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Material and Methods</h3>\r\n<p>A total twenty cases of Vulvar lichen Sclerosus not responsive to the traditional therapy were enrolled.</p>\r\n<p>Age of participants ranged from 50 to 65 years old (mean age 55,2). VLS duration ranged from 2 to 5 years, and all the patients were no responsive to the traditional therapy  Table 1.</p>\r\n<p>To evaluate the diagnosis and the progression the symptoms were used the clinical examination and the dermatoscopy.</p>\r\n<p>The lesions were localized in the anterior and posterior part of the introitus with ulcerative lesions and initial introitus stenosis.</p>\r\n<p>All the patients complained about intractable pruritus (worse at night), irritation, soreness, dyspareunia, dysuria Figure 1. The patient received three different treatments  of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), separated by 4 weeks, with a resolution of the symptoms.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Treatment and Progress</h3>\r\n<p>We decided to treat the patient with Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) in order to improve the local symptomatology and to allow the healing of the wound. The effectiveness of PRP is  based on its high level of growth factors such as PDGF, TGF-beta, and EGF. These growth factors are important in modulating mesenchymal cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix  synthesis during healing. The vast majority of published literature shows that autologous PRP has minimal risk formation or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).</p>\r\n<p>According to Goldstein et al. we have been decided to treat the patients with PRP, because PRP has shown to be effective at reducing ulcers in a lot of medical conditions such  as diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and tendinopathy [9,10].</p>\r\n<p>On examination all the patients presented ulcerative erosions of the anterior and posterior part of the introitus, initial introital stenosis, with intractable pruritus  (worse at night), irritation, soreness, dyspareunia, dysuria.</p>\r\n<p>The patients have been previously treated with local corticosteroids with no reductions of the sintomatology.</p>\r\n<p>We administered three treatments [3], the first two at fifteen day intervals and the last one thirty days after the second treatment. We noticed a great improvement in the  mucosae since the first treatment, with a reduction of the erythema. Erosions and symptoms were still present.</p>\r\n<p>After the third treatment there were no more erosions, atrophia of the mucosae was reduced and the symptoms that had been presented had disappeared Figure 2.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>This cases illustrate the possibility to treat VLS with PRP.</p>\r\n<p>PRP is a solution derived from whole blood that is enriched in the platelet fraction. Platelets serve as a reservoir of growth factors and cytokines and, when applied to wound beds,  promote healing of complex wounds.</p>\r\n<p>In brief, we collected 9 ml of blood in a tube and we added 1 ml of sodium citrate (10 ml in total). The collected blood was centrifuged at first, for 5 minutes at 1200 RCF,  at environmental temperature (22&ordm;C). Then, a red lower fraction (red cell component) and an upper straw-yellow turbid fraction (serum component) were observed.</p>\r\n<p>After that we centrifuged for a second time for 10 minutes at 1200 RCF.</p>\r\n<p>We obtained 3 ml of serum component that was injected with 1 ml syringes in the mucosae of the vagina and the in the skin of the vulva.</p>\r\n<p>Platelet-rich plasma stimulates angiogenesis, promoting vascular in-growth and fibroblast proliferation.</p>\r\n<p>In our cases, VLS responded to the treatment with PRP. We believe that the administration of PRP should be considered in patients with no-responsive VLS, however, further  studies are needed to demonstrate the validity of the method.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291001\" target=\"_blank\">P&eacute;rez-L&oacute;pez FR, Ceausu I, Depypere H, Erel CT, Lambrinoudaki I, et al.

Many trials demonstrate high  sensitivity and specificity of this screening test, estimated respectively at 99.3% and 99.9% for trisomy 21, 97.4% and 99.8% for trisomy 18, and 91.6% and 99.9% for trisomy 13 [1-3].  The positive predictive value (PPV) for a given aneuploidy is limited by low prevalence and is most influenced by patient age, therefore leading to a low positive predictive value.  The low predictive value of cfDNA for trisomy 13 is most striking because it is less commonly encountered than trisomies 18 or 21: the PPV for a 25-year-old patient is 9%, while it  increases to 57% for a 40-year-old patient [3].</p>\r\n<p>Despite the superior sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA compared to traditional hormonal-based maternal serum screening, positive test results require a confirmatory diagnostic  test. False-positive results may be caused by events such as a co-twin demise, maternal chromosome abnormalities, or maternal malignancy [4-9]. More recently, placental mosaicism is  a known cause which may lead to positive cfDNA testing that is not concordant with final fetal karyotype [1,10]. Understanding all potential causes of a positive cfDNA result is  required to provide appropriate genetic counseling. Given the ethical and medico legal considerations involved, informing patients of cfDNA screening limitations (false-positive,  false-negative, and non-reportable results) is a critical aspect of this counseling. Moreover, it is important to counsel patients on the diagnostic limitations regarding CVS when  attempting to confirm a cfDNA test result because both tests rely upon placentally-derived trophoblastic tissues. While not available until later gestational ages, amniocentesis  maintains the advantage of testing actual fetal-derived cells within amniotic fluid.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Case</h3>\r\n<p>A 41-year-old gravida 2 para 1 desired non-invasive aneuploidy screening and underwent cell free DNA (cfDNA) using QNatalTM Advanced cfDNA screening test (Quest Diagnostics,  Secaucus, NJ) at 10 weeks&rsquo; gestation. The cfDNA screening test, which uses circulating DNA from placental cytotrophoblast as a surrogate for fetal DNA, was consistent with trisomy 13.  She was referred to our center at 13 weeks&rsquo; gestation and met with a genetic counselor. First trimester anatomic evaluation did not identify any anomalies to help corroborate the  cfDNA results. She opted for diagnostic testing with chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and karyotype of cultured mesenchymal cells  demonstrated trisomy 13, consistent with the initial cfDNA screening test. Due to the normal first trimester anatomic survey and counseling regarding the limitations to differentiate  between placental mosaicism and a true positive trisomy 13 result in her fetus, the patient desired amniocentesis. A detailed ultrasound at 16 weeks&rsquo; gestation did not identify any  structural abnormalities or soft markers for aneuploidy. After this ultrasound, she underwent an amniocentesis, which showed normal interphase FISH and karyotype of cultured amniocytes  (46, XX). She was counseled that the most likely explanation for the discordant results between the cfDNA and CVS versus amniocentesis was confined placental mosaicism. The patient  continued the pregnancy which was not complicated further in the setting of confined placental mosaicism. She delivered a healthy female infant at 37 weeks&rsquo; gestation. The infant was  admitted to the newborn nursery and discharged home on hospital day two. Postnatal karyotype on neonatal blood was normal (46, XX).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Invasive prenatal diagnosis is necessary to confirm a positive cfDNA test prior to termination of pregnancy as per American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society  for Maternal-Fetal Medicine guidelines [3]. Despite the exceedingly high performance of cfDNA for trisomies, false-positive testing is common with trisomy 13 given a low prevalence  even with advanced maternal age. For trisomy 18, nearly two false-positive results are expected per accurate cfDNA test result, and for trisomy 13 the expected false-positive to  true-positive rate is approximately one to one [11]. Given the potential for confined placental mosaicism, CVS may not be the best confirmatory test for all patients with cfDNA  positive for trisomy 13 who do not have corroborative ultrasound findings and are considering pregnancy termination. Detailed fetal ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram represent  additional options to look for typical anatomical defects to assist in making an early diagnosis. In a desired pregnancy, skepticism of trisomy 13 diagnosis should be maintained  in the setting of normal fetal anatomy.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>After positive cfDNA, CVS is the earliest available confirmatory diagnostic test recommended prior to pursuit of pregnancy termination for trisomy. The major limitation of CVS  in this circumstance is related to the fact that the same tissue origin is tested with cfDNA and may not reflect true fetal karyotype. Genetic counseling should include the discussion  of reasons for positive results including true fetal karyotype, as well as false positives due to conditions such as confined placental mosaicism. In the setting of normal fetal  ultrasound and abnormal cfDNA, it is important to consider placental mosaicism as a cause of misdiagnosis. Finally, as in the case of the patient presented, amniocentesis was the  superior test of choice given the unacceptability of pregnancy termination for this patient in the setting of placental mosaicism. Early anatomic survey may strengthen the diagnostic  yield of CVS prior to pregnancy termination for trisomy 13 [12].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\">Conflict of Interest Statement</h3>\r\n<p>All authors together report no intellectual, financial, or positional conflicts of interest related to the proposed manuscript.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Funding Statement</h3>\r\n<p>No funding was received or utilized in the preparation of this manuscript.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27526871\" target=\"_blank\">Grace MR, Hardisty E, Dotters-Katz SK, Vora NL, Kuller JA (2016) Cell-free DNA screening: complexities and challenges of clinical implementation.

Recently, Trauma and spondylotic myelopathy are the most reasons for this procedure [1].  Rare side effects for this surgery are reported but it can become troubling [2]. Dura tearing, dysphagia, and hematoma after the surgery, Laryngeal recurrent nerve paralysis, Horner  syndrome, and esophageal perforation are the most possible side effects which are reported in papers so far [3]. A number of intensive side effects are reported which are caused by  screw pull out and plate dislocation which are mentioned into previous reports [4]. We are supposed to consider a case which is about a middle-aged woman that caused screw pull out  and then outbreak of dysphagia, 20 years after the surgery of ACDF.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Case Presentation</h3>\r\n<p>A 61 years old woman referred to us complaining about odynophagia and dysphagia. She had neck trauma background caused by car accident in 1998 and then she was operated - by  the writer of this paper - for traumatic disk herniation of C4-C5 in Mashhad&rsquo;s Ghaem hospital. The patient&rsquo;s fusion was done by autologous iliac graft and she had no neurologic  symptoms and discharged from hospital with no side effects of surgical operation. Moreover, follow-up of the patient was normal and had no side effects sign of surgical operation.  Now, she referred to gastroenterologist for sudden odynophagia and dysphagia and then she was examed by endoscopy and no pathological findings were seen. Therefore, she was referred  to ENT doctor because of cervical lymphadenopathy and slight fever, doubting retropharyngeal abscess symptom; however, no laboratory abnormalities and infection symptoms were observed.  Upper respiratory tract endoscopy was prescribed for the patient by the ENT doctor which no pathological trace was found and then, she was advised for cervical CT scan and also she  was then advised to refer to neurosurgeon, regarding the background of cervical spine surgery.</p>\r\n<p>She was referred to us, while she has been operated by us in 20 years ago. But she had no neurologic and clinical symptoms in our checkup. So, as the first step, we were prepared  for imaging of cervical lateral and then it was shown the dislocation of upper left plate screw and fusion between the C4 and C5 was seen (Figure 1). Then the patient was candidate  for an immediate operation and the whole instrumentation removed, (Figure 2) while there was no trace of infection, pus, or inflammation. The patient&rsquo;s instrument sent for bacterial  culture and the result was negative.</p>\r\n<p>The patient was sent for ENT physician and gastroenterologist and there was no need for any implementation. After 2 days, she was discharged from hospital in complete recovered  condition and without any symptom of surgical operation.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>We have studied a case about the screw pull out after 20 years, regarding that Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) that are the most common surgical operations of  cervical spine. The side effects of this surgery are very rare [1,5] and some studies have been done around this procedure which show the slight side effects of this procedure.  Instrumentation raises some side effects like screw pull out [6,7]. Lower and et al showed 18 percent of anterior cervical spine instrumentations become fail [8]. esophagus tear  after surgery is a common side effect but that is rare after failure of instrumentation, [4,9] however, mortality after esophagus perforation in this kind of patients is about 20  to 65 percent which depends upon the pull out delay and also, perforation causes mediastinitis, pleuritis, sepsis, pneumonia, and fistula [10]. However, in seldom cases screw  dislocation caused airway injuries and death [11].</p>\r\n<p>The first case of screw dislocation and esophagus perforation was reported in 1971 [12]. Kostas and et al have reported a case of screw dislocation and penetrating into digestive  system after 16 months of surgical operation; however, the plates and screws have been pulled out by surgeons [4]. Quadri and et al reported an operation screws pull out and esophagus  perforations from an 85 years old man which took place 3.5 years after the surgical operation [5]. In other study which were done by Lu and et al, they reported a case that screw  dislocation caused esophagus perforation after 9 years [13]. In a study done by Gazzeri and et al, screw pull out has been occurred after 11 years passed away surgical operation  which caused esophagus perforation [1]. The difference between the cases noted above and this case is that the screw pulled out after 20 years&rsquo; delay and the other difference is  that in the most cases reported, screw pullout caused esophagus perforation; meanwhile, there was fortunately no complication which make the patient to refer to a physician after  a while.</p>\r\n<p>In most cases which are reported, screw pull out cause esophagus perforation, but in a rare case the screw pullout didn&rsquo;t cause pharynx perforation [5]. Esophageal perforation  can bring some side effects from slight to deadly; so, immediate detection is very important and vital. The most reason which cause screw pullout can be including incorrect initial  placement of screw or screw suboptimal place [1]. In other cases which reported by Pompili and et al, incomplete screw lock caused screw dislocation [14]. In cases that screw pulled  out, immediate removing the instrument is advised. Esophagogram is advised for observing esophagus injuries. Moreover, diagnostic actions are advised for mediastinitis rollout,  pneumonia, and sepsis [4].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Finally, it is concluded that however, instrumentation of anterior cervical spine is so common and has very slight side effects, dangerous consequences may take place in case  of side effects. Delayed Screw pullout is very rare in this type of patients and may cause deadly injuries for them. Therefore, it is advised that the patients were under this  surgical operation should be aware of likely side effects of screw pullout and esophagus perforation, because immediate detection of this complication is very helpful in recovery  of patients.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/spne/200804150/00007632-200804150-00023\" target=\"_blank\">Gazzeri R, Tamorri M, Faiola A, Gazzeri G (2008) Delayed migration of a screw into the gastrointestinal tract after anterior cervical spine plating.

Positively  <em>C. jejuny</em> isolated from frozen bovine meat according to Stern et al. <em>Campylobacter jejuny</em> is microaerophilic, produces heat labile enterotoxin, can cause in human  campylobacteriosis with symptoms of meningitis, pneumonia, miscarriage and a severe form of Guillain - Barr&eacute; syndrome, non-life threatening, diarrhoea to mimicking acute appendicitis.  Microscopically <em>C. jejuny</em> is gram negative rods with comma shaped. This research finds the result, out of 61 samples of frozen buffalo meat 49 samples found positive and  12 samples negative for <em>C. jejuny</em> in frozen condition. Campylobacter Agar Base with charcoal and sheep blood exhibit thick translucent white or gray or colorless growth  with spreading, film-like transparent flat or moist growth at 37<sup>o</sup>C and 42<sup>o</sup>C for 2 - 5 days. Antibiotic assay test revealed <em>C. jejuny</em> more sensitive  to 10 &mu;g amoxyclave &amp; little sensitive or resistant to 5 &mu;g methicillin. Approximately other sources of contamination and risk assessment tested at Abattoir like air - out of 25  sample 100% samples are positive, out of 25 samples of water 35% samples are positive, out of 25 samples of slaughter instrument 100% are positive &amp; Food handlers hand swab out  of 25 samples 100% are positive. Therefore, the tolerances are very high in frozen buffalo meat and resulted due to unhygienic practice at abattoir, processing of buffalo meat  and create food borne diseases which decreases quality and increases the level of risk of food borne disease.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>; Frozen Buffalo Meat; Campylobacteriosis</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> S-shaped, curved or spiral Gram negative bacillus. The bacteria are highly motile with corkscrew like motion. It grows mostly on microaerophilic  condition i.e. at reduced 5% O<sub>2</sub> &amp; added 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. At present Campylobacteriosis is a major human food borne disease noticed worldwide [1,2], which is dominantly  believed to be associated with consumption of improperly handled and unhygienically processed frozen buffalo meat at abattoir in India. <em>C. jejuni</em> is a zoonotic foodborne  pathogen and one of the causes of colitis in zoonotic countries. The main reservoir of this bacteria in alimentary tract of different animals and at present here in buffalo  alimentary tract in New Delhi, India abattoir. The optimum growth temperature is 42&deg;C and also can grow in 37&deg;C. Two or five days after consumption of injected or infested  contaminated frozen bovine meat gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal cramps, fever and diarrhea will appear, vomiting usually not present but diarrhea may sometime become  horrific, turns to bloody diarrhea or dysentery [7,18,19]. <em>Campylobacter</em> is highly susceptible to environmental stresses, like variations in temperature, humidity,  osmolarity, presence of sunlight and atmospheric oxygen. [2] This study conducted on frozen bovine meat after processing at very low temperature but, sampling resulted and busted  out with tolerance and survivability of the organisms O<sub>2</sub> at bovine abattoir in India. Studies elsewhere have demonstrated that <em>Campylobacter</em> survive in raw and cooked poultry  meat during refrigerated or frozen storage. [3,4,5,6] The objective of this study were to determine potential sources of human disease along with prevalence and survivability of  the organism connection in zoonotic foodborne illness at a point in slaughter house after thorough processing samples collected and examine the influence of organism and recovery  of <em>C. jejuni</em> when gaining familiarity with <em>C. jejuni</em> isolation procedures.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">History and Disease Report</h3>\r\n<p>Veterinary Microbiologist prior to 1970 known <em>Campylobater</em> as an organism that cause spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep and cause of other animal pathogens.  It appears sensitive to freeze. <em>C. jejuni</em> reported isolated from frozen bovine muscle meat. [9] <em>C. jejuni</em> is occasionally invasive and infections are manifested  as meningitis, pneumonia, miscarriage and a severe form of Guillain - Barr&eacute; syndrome. [10.11] <em>C. jejuni</em> produces heat labile enterotoxins. It is reported that in 2007 in  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia different samples of chilled and frozen chicken carcasses have been tested and <em>C. jejuni</em> confirmed present in the samples. [12] Human  Campylobacteriosis also reported in chilled and frozen poultry meat in Brazil. [13] It is also reported in USA and New Zealand during storage of beef trimming in freezing and frozen  condition <em>C. jejuni</em> causes a wide range of debilitating, but non &ndash; life - threatening, symptoms, from diarrhoea to mimicking acute appendicitis. In addition, the rare  immune - mediated neuropathic Guillain &ndash; Barr&eacute; syndrome that is characterized by ascending paralysis and occasional death. [14] In a study of raw meat of beef and chicken it is  reported that samples contaminated with <em>C. jejuni</em> [15].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Morphology and Cultural Characteristics</h3>\r\n<p><em>Campylobacter</em> are microaerophilic (reduced 5% O<sub>2</sub> &amp; added 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, Oxygen quenching agents such as Hemin and Charcoal used in media), gram negative  rods with comma, S or &ldquo;gull - wing&rdquo; shapes, 0.5&ndash;8 &mu;m in length and 0.2 &ndash; 0.5 &mu;m in width, cells are pleomorphic, non &ndash; spore forming, very small, slender, curved or spiral shape and  one or more polar or amphitrichous flagella shows corkscrew movement of bacilli, as old cultures spiral or curved bacilli are replaced by round forms. <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>  are cultured in microaerophilic condition at reduced 5% O<sub>2</sub> &amp; added 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in media, charcoal used as effective substitute in media. On blood agar it is  non - haemolytic. Here Campylobacter Blood Charcoal Agar Base supplemented with 5-7% sterile lysed horse blood or 10% sterile defibrinated sheep blood and Campylobacter supplement I  (Blaser - Wang) or Campylobacter Supplement III (Skirrow) and Charcoal is used [16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Materials and Methods</h3>\r\n<p><b>Sample Collection:</b> - Collect 100 gm of frozen buffalo meat sample, transport them in an insulated shipping container enough gel - type to maintain refrigerant at 6&deg;C or  below. Upon receipt in the laboratory, store the samples at 4&deg;C and analyze immediately. If analysis cannot be started within 4 days after collection, freeze samples promptly and  store at -20&deg;C until examined. Thaw at room temperature and proceed with analysis as usual. Maintain frozen samples at -20&deg;C until examined.</p>\r\n<p>Method: -Within 100gm sample 25gm frozen buffalo meat samples are weighed aseptically inside laminar air flow and add 225mL of 0.1% peptone water homogenized the mixture in a  blender and used as pre-enrichment solution according [16] sampling method as mentioned above. Incubate the pre-enrichment at 37oC for 24hrs. After incubation pour plate on the  <em>Campylobacter</em> Blood Charcoal Agar Base supplemented with 5-7% sterile lysed horse blood or 10% sterile defibrinated sheep blood and <em>Campylobacter</em> supplement I  (Blaser-Wang) or <em>Campylobacter</em> Supplement III (Skirrow) and Charcoal. Incubate at 37oC and 42oC for 2 - 5 days undergo moist, microaerophilic condition in a anaerobic  jar or wrapped it with aluminium foil. Observe the plates for presence or absence of colonies.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Observation</h3>\r\n<p><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> exhibit thick translucent white or gray or colourless growth to spreading, film-like transparent growth or watery, convex, pinpointed, round,  irregular and smooth edges colonies and also show water droplets on charcoal agar.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Biochemical Confirmation</h3>\r\n<p><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> is microscopically gram negative rods and biochemically confirmed as motile, oxidase positive, catalase positive, ferment carbohydrates,  H<sub>2</sub>S on TSI negative.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Antibiotic Sensitivity of <em>C. jejuni</em></h3>\r\n<p>Antibiogram test on recovered positive <em>C. jejuni</em> isolates conducted to look for acquired whether antibiotic resistant <em>C. jejuni</em> organisms takes part in creating  food borne diseases during human consumption. These assessment measure actual potential source may come from cattle feed and may come from insertion of antibiotic to control diseases  in buffalo. These conveyed as natural phenomena and transferred through genetically acquired antibiotic resistant plasmid DNA to human after the meat consumption. As a result, when  disease acquired higher dose or higher generation of antibiotic used to cure the disease. Lower dose of antibiotic become ineffective. In this research few samples of isolated  positive <em>C. jejuni</em> colonies analyzed. <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> positive colonies picked from few samples of frozen buffalo meat and tested with three antibiotic discs  like 5&mu;g methicillin disc, 10&mu;g amoxyclave discs which incubated at 37oC for 24 hours. 1.7 cm zone of inhibition appears on around methicillin disc and 7mm zone of inhibition appears  around methicillin disc. Hence <em>Campylobacter</em> more sensitive to 10&mu;g amoxyclave disc but less sensitive to 5&mu;g methicillin disc.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Risk Assessment from The Potential Sources of Abattoir Environment</h3>\r\n<p>The assessment of potential risk is important to signify that potential risk depend on different contaminant present in abattoir environment which contaminate frozen buffalo  meat while processing and resultant in spoilage. To assess and analyze these potential risk sources are summarize and significant in all respect. Most importantly, air present  inside abattoir where aerosols are major potent source which need to analyze frequently with conventional way i.e. by sedimentation technique of exposing the plates in plant  environment. Food handler&rsquo;s hand, equipment, machineries, cracks and crevices with wall and floor swab analysis can provide potential source to identify contaminating areas.  On the other hand, potential and significant source can identify through most probable number (MPN) test of water which used in washing floors and other used utensils. During  assessing the risk of <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> from air, it is observed that out of 25 samples almost 100% of the samples are positive for <em>C. jejuni</em>. While screening  the water samples used in plant by pour plate technique, it is evident out of 25 samples, 35% of the samples found positive. During investigation of other pathogenic organisms  through swabbing slaughter house instrument after wash out of 25 swab samples analysis yield 100% of the samples are positive. Even when check and analyze 25 swabbing samples  of food handlers and butchers where 100% of the samples observed as positive. It means during processing and post-processing an unhygienic practice prevail which can contaminate  and help in spoilage of the food at very low temperature. This is significantly dangerous for human consumption and requires standard international and national level regulatory  authority to set microbiological and other signicant parameter before export from New Delhi, India to maintain it strictly. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s a not only economic loss of the  manufacturer and buyer, but, at the same time economic loss and honor for the country. At the end, safe food production and safe consumption will open the way to new era of food  production.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Results and Discussions</h3>\r\n<p>Indeed, present research experiments of frozen buffalo meat where 61 samples have been pursued for analysis to identify <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>, but 49 samples found  positive and 12 samples found negative. Hence, as a result this finding expressed processing of buffalo meat yield the results of tolerance of <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> at  very low temperature can withstand the temperature and survive in very low temperature too can cause spoilage of the food. The research and investigation reported organism&rsquo;s  tolerances are very high in frozen buffalo meat and resulted unhygienic processing of buffalo meat, compromising with quality and increases the risk of food borne diseases.  The most common species of <em>Campylobacter</em> in animals and foods are <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>. <em>C. jejuni</em> involved in human gastroenteritis. <em>C. jejuni</em>  in raw meat of animals detected in Iran [17]. Hippurate hydrolysis is the only biochemical test which can differentiate between <em>C. jejuni</em> and other <em>Campylobacter</em>  species. [18,19,20,21] Present investigation of frozen buffalo meat reported that <em>C. jejuni</em> can survive frozen storage or shipment. Freezing is harmful to the organism  and can lower isolation rate. The deleterious effect of freezing has been reported. [22,23] Fresh and frozen poultry collected at slaughter and recovered <em>C. jejuni</em> have  been reported in a study. [24] In a complete study on Bovine Genital <em>Campylobacteriosis</em> is a bacterial disease caused by <em>Campylobacter</em> fetus subspecies veneralis isolated  from cows, buffalos and cattles in Australia. The disease is characterized by temporary infertility of female cattle as a result of a sub-acute diffuse mucopurulent cervicitis,  endometritis and salpingitis. Abortions occurred in small percentage of cows and buffalos months after initial infection [25]. Prevalence and survivability of <em>C. jejuni</em>  as initial level of aerobic bacteria and failure to decrease in number of beef trimmings during frozen storage has been reported. [26] One of the study investigated <em>C. jejuni</em>  in Turky meat during storage the impact of the storage factors on its survivability based on effects of storage temperature, storage period and the interruption of the cooling chain  on its survival have been evaluated. [27] According to result it suggests that freezing offers a short- to long-term solution to the safe storage of buffalo meat with respect to  the survival of <em>Campylobacter</em>. While it does not entirely eliminate potentially infectious <em>Campylobacter</em>, the initial reduction achieved in its population using  this method may have a substantial impact on reducing the incidence of campylo- bacteriosis [29] These results also demonstrate the existence of injured cells in the frozen bacterial  population. To prevent <em>campylobacteriosis</em>, it is suggested to spray chlorinated water up to 50ppm in concentration during slaughtering, skinning and evisceration under  aseptic conditions on buffalo carcasses. Before the consumption of frozen buffalo meat food, the processed raw frozen buffalo meat must cook undergo temperature reach at least  77&deg;C and 82&deg;C respectively. To model the survival kinetics of <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> on frozen chicken meat studied elaborately by. [28] in Netherland.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> can recovered from mostly all cuts of frozen buffalo meat. This research concentrated only on frozen buffalo meat recovery of <em>C. jejuni</em> and  its survival capacity in very low freezing, but not concentrated on chilled meat recovery. The detection from frozen buffalo meat is pretty high and denotes <em>C. jejuni</em>  survivability capacity and adaptation during freezing environment. Overall, as a reason of survival lead to food deterioration and spoilage. Diseases caused by  <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> are increasing in significance worldwide. Infact, cross contamination through mishandling of frozen buffalo meat during processing at abattoir and the  failure to maintain the storage condition increasing. The result show that raw frozen buffalo meat must be considered to increased <em>C. jejuni</em> contamination rate. Therefore,  there will be a considerable risk of <em>C. jejuni</em> infection in consumers either through direct contamination or cross-contamination during handling or processing of raw frozen  meat. However, in order to prevent Campylobacter jejuni contamination and foodborne diseases, consistently practice good hygiene at buffalo meat processing and handling as well as  consumer education mandatorily implement.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Acknowledgement</h3>\r\n<p>I am grateful to the Chancellor of Kalinga University, Ph.

It has contributed enormously to public health including the  eradication of small pox and near eradication of poliomyelitis. High immunization coverage is vital in the control, elimination and eradication of vaccine preventable diseases  which accounts for many childhood morbidities and mortalities worldwide. The introduction of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) has made remarkable progress, which  includes improvement of immunization coverage among infants and women resulting in considerable reduction in morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. Though,  immunization coverage rates have improved in recent times, there are areas with poor coverage which may possibly lead to build-up of susceptible children and probably cause  disease outbreak. Assin North is one of such places with poor immunization coverage.</p>\r\n<p><b>Methods: </b>A cross sectional survey was conducted to collect data from 672 mothers or caregivers of children between the ages of 12-23 months from 30 randomly selected  communities within the Assin north municipality using a structured questionnaire. Immunization card and maternal recall were used to assess vaccination status. Chi square and  logistic regression models were used to assess the association between vaccination status and the independent variables.</p>\r\n<p><b>Results: </b>The proportion of fully immunized children between the ages of 12-23 months in the Assin north district was 85.4 %( 574/672). The rest were partially immunized.  Maternal factors that affected immunization coverage included the maternal age, occupation, education level and knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases. Reasons  for immunization failure included mothers too busy, unaware of the need to return for subsequent immunization, and inconvenient immunization schedules to the mothers.</p>\r\n<p><b>Conclusion: </b>The immunization coverage for children aged 12-23 months in the Assin north municipal is high. It however, fell short of the recommended 90% target. Level of  education and source of knowledge were significantly associated with immunization status.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Chi Square; Immunization; Immunization Failure; Regression; Logistics Vaccine Preventable Diseases</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Background</h3>\r\n<p>Immunization is one of the major public health strategies to avoid childhood illnesses and mortality. In the absence of immunization, more than five million children would die each  year because of diseases that could have otherwise been prevented through vaccination(Ngure, 2015). Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health  investments that can be made for future generations. It is a key strategy and indicator of the achievement of the fourth Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and now sustainable  development goals(SDGs) which aims at reducing the 1990&rsquo;s child mortality rate by two thirds by 2015 [1] (Owino, Irimu, Olenja, &amp; Meme, 2009).</p>\r\n<p>Almost one third of deaths among children under 5years are preventable by vaccine. UNICEF and its partners are working to change these numbers and ensure that the lives of all  children are successfully protected with vaccines. If immunization is not prioritized, the most marginalized children will not get vaccines, which could mean the difference between  life and death (WHO/UNICEF, 2016) Globally, nearly one in five infants thus, an estimated 19.4 million children missed out on the basic vaccines they need to stay healthy in 2015.  Low immunization levels compromise gains in all other areas of health for mothers and children. The poorest and most vulnerable children who need immunization the most continue to be  the least likely to get it (WHO/UNICEF, 2016).</p>\r\n<p>Available vaccines can protect against about 30 diseases, and the quest to develop other vaccines continues (Ansong et al., 2014). Regardless of interventions made to boost  immunization services, 2-3 million children are dying annually from vaccine preventable diseases, and many more fall ill(&rsquo;World Health Organization&rsquo;, 2015). Also, 1.5 million deaths  could be avoided if global vaccination coverage improves. Global vaccination coverage has remained steadily high for the past few years (&rsquo;World Health Organization&rsquo;, 2015).</p>\r\n<p>Vaccination coverage is the percentage of a target population that receives the full schedule of vaccinations. The schedule includes all the vaccinations recommended by the  Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), applied at the correct ages (epidemiological adequacy) and correct intervals (immunological adequacy)(Vision, 2014). Combined institutional  activities organized by the public sector at various levels are required to achieve adequate vaccination coverage. Knowledge of vaccination coverage facilitates monitoring the volume  of susceptible individuals in the population as well as the identification of factors related to child health and service performance, supporting the planning and restructuring of  vaccination program (Martinez, Stuardo, &amp; Rocha, 2014). Investigations into the reasons for low coverage to vaccination programs are proposed by experts in the medical field and aim  to guide interventions to reverse this situation and ensure greater protection for the populations at greater risk.</p>\r\n<p>The factors that interfere with vaccination coverage can be grouped into four areas: immunization system (policy), thus structure for vaccine distribution, parent knowledge and  attitudes about the vaccination programs, communication and information, and family characteristics. The family characteristics involves low-income status, residence in rural areas,  extremes of maternal age, high parity, low maternal education level, larger families, residence in the area for &lt; 1 year, mother working outside the home, lack of knowledge about  vaccine-preventable diseases, transportation difficulties, labor disputes around workdays lost to care for children, lack of health insurance, and presence of disease among the  children (Town &amp; Ayano, 2015). Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to stimulate an individual&rsquo;s immune system in order to develop specific immunity to a disease causing  organism; and immunization is the process by which an individual&rsquo;s immune system becomes fortified against an agent of disease. Immunization can be achieved in an active or passive  manner: vaccination is an active form of immunization and the two terms are used interchangeably (Ansong et al., 2014).</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, all 194 WHO Member States endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) which committed every member state to achieve a set target of 90 percent DTP3 vaccination coverage  by 2015. As a result, the number of children who did not receive routine life-saving vaccinations has dropped to an estimated 19.4 million, down from 33.8 million in 2000. Most  progress has been made in India, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while coverage in Pakistan and Indonesia is stagnating. While many countries, such as India, Lao,  Chad, and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) show sustained progress over the longer term, other countries are yet to show improvement in their performance (Indonesia, Pakistan).  Other countries have not been able to sustain high coverage levels (Guatemala and Congo), or have seen positive trends reverted recently (Angola and Mauritania) [1].</p>\r\n<p>The Ebola outbreak in West Africa 2014 and 2015 had a different impact in each of the affected countries. Sierra Leone experienced a relatively mild impact on programme performance  (-9 percentage points in 2014) and already seems to be recovering well, while Liberia recorded a coverage of 26 percentages in 2014. The number of countries using new vaccines such as  rotavirus (81 countries) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (128 countries) has increased, but global coverage remains low at 23% and 32%, respectively. Vaccine introduction is  especially lagging in middle income countries. These countries are often not able to finance introduction with national resources, while they generally don&rsquo;t have access to external  funding sources [1].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Immunization in Ghana</h3>\r\n<p>The introduction of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) as a key component of Primary Health Care in Ghana dates back to 1978. Since then the EPI has made remarkable  progress, which includes improvement of immunization coverage among infants and women resulting in considerable reduction in morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>\r\n<p>In line with global targets set at the World Health Assembly in 1988, the Ghana EPI has expanded its focus from vaccination coverage to include eradication of poliomyelitis and  elimination of measles and neonatal tetanus (NT), which requires intensive disease surveillance and control measures. The country also made substantial progress in the reduction of  morbidity and mortality due to measles, and has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus as a public health problem. Immunization performance has become a key health performance  indicator for the entire health sector and is monitored at all levels [2].</p>\r\n<p>The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) prescribes that children get vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) at birth; three doses of  Pentavalent vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and OPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age; rotavirus vaccine at 6 and 10 weeks, Yellow Fever vaccine at 9months and measles vaccine at 9 months  and 18 months of age. Penta-3 (Third dose of Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus vaccine) has been used as the proxy indicator to measure the improvement in childhood immunization.  The national average of Penta-3 coverage increased from 90% in 2014 to 95.4% in 2015, however 29% (63) of the 216 districts in Ghana, could not achieve the 80% coverage target for  Penta 3 coverage in 2015. The Greater Accra region recorded the highest number (44,487) of unimmunized [3].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Problem Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In 2015, globally, nearly one in five infants thus, an estimated 19.4 million children missed out on the basic vaccines they need to stay healthy whereas about 86% (116 million)  received 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, protecting them against infectious diseases that can cause serious illness and disability. By 2015, 126 countries had  reached at least 90% coverage of DTP3 vaccine [1] (WHO, 2015a).</p>\r\n<p>The goal of EPI Programme is to obtain and sustain 90% coverage for all the antigens in line with WHO target. The national immunisation records show that there has been an increase  in vaccination coverage rates for all the antigens in the country for the past ten years. There are variations in the immunisation coverage rates between regions and among districts.</p>\r\n<p>The Penta-3 coverage in Ghana increased from 90% in 2014 to 95.4% in 2015.However, almost 30 % (63 districts) could not achieve the 80% coverage target for Penta 3 coverage  in 2015 (Ghana health service, 2015). Assin North municipality was one of the districts. The municipality had adequate coverage ranging between 83% -94% from 2009 to 2011. However,  the coverage from 2012 to 2015 is far below the national average. This coverage ranges between 52%-63 %( DHD, 2016).</p>\r\n<p>Despite all the interventions like mop up campaign, child health promotion, and home visits adopted by the District Health Directorate, the coverage is still below the expected.  Therefore, this research which intends to unearth the factors leading to low coverage rate would help identify some challenges associated with low coverage immunization services on  the part of mothers/caregivers and the entire district health system and to identify key strategies to improve service coverage.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Explanation of Conceptual Framework</h3>\r\n<p>In 1973, Andersen and Newman proposed a framework for evaluating the utilization of health care ((Petrovic &amp; Blank, 2015)). The model assumes that, utilization of health services  is a function of predisposing, enabling and need factors. Predisposing characteristics include gender, marital status, and educational status, and occupation, length of time in the  community and health beliefs. The health beliefs include attitudes of health workers and knowledge on health. Enabling resources refer to attributes specific to the individual or the  community (e.g. income, social network, and access to regular source of care). Need variables reflect illness levels that require the use of health services? It can be perceived by  the individual and are influenced by cultural beliefs and values. There is also an enabling resource which could be individual or community attributes.</p>\r\n<p>From the conceptual framework above, routine immunization service coverage is influenced by a number of interrelated factors. Among these interconnected factors is the poor quality  of immunization service delivery factor, which in turn is affected by long waiting time experienced caregivers during immunization. Poorly motivated and staff overloaded with a lot  of activities at the same time due to low staff numbers and inadequate logistics to be used during immunization sessions like means of transport causing undue delay by the health  workers to work.</p>\r\n<p>Another factor that affects the immunization service coverage is socio economic factors including mothers having problem with the means of transport to immunization center due  to poor road network linking such communities to the designated centers, lack of funds on the part of mothers to meet some financial obligations like feeding for that long period  of stay at the center, transport fare and most importantly mothers inability to pay the token fees collected by staff at the center and this one at times will not be too encouraging  for a mother whose child is not sick to come for immunization service.</p>\r\n<p>Immunization strategy chosen by the staff will surely, affects the utilization because strategy determines the distance between the caregiver and the service to be delivered.  For instance, home visits gets services closer to the client than static strategy whereby the staff are at one point where the caregiver will have to travel to utilize the service  being provided at the facility.</p>\r\n<p>Caregiver&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding of importance of immunization and the EPI schedule play an indispensable role in EPI service utilization because if caregivers are aware  of the dates, time and place for the various categories of the vaccines, they will follow diligently. Coverage also worsens when the DHA&rsquo;s educational campaign on EPI does not reach  a greater section of the mothers in the hinterland or hard-to-reach areas. Therefore, the utilization of the EPI coverage by caregivers is highly dependent on these inevitable  enumerated factors.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Justification</h3>\r\n<p>The commonest childhood diseases namely; Measles, Diarrhea, Pneumonia, Poliomyelitis, Tuberculosis, Tetanus, Yellow Fever, Whooping Cough which were mainly responsible for the  mortality in Ghana are now less reported at our facilities dues to the introduction of immunization. Therefore, an effort towards achieving healthier childhood is very critical to  all stakeholders or health partners. An assessment of the activities of the program therefore, is vital in realizing the extent to which survival intervention is being utilized by  the target population in the respective districts.</p>\r\n<p>This research seeks to assess factors contributing to immunization uptake by children and caregivers, find out possible reasons that might account for low coverage by caregivers.  Again the findings of the study would be used as confirmatory evidence to linked previous reports given by the District Health Directorate on EPI or identify difference and suggest  corrective measures accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>The study will inform the DHMT, policy makers, funding agencies and other stakeholders on management tools to employ to increase EPI service utilization and reduce defaulter rates,  increase coverage levels for of immunization and finally reduce the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases in the Assin north municipality. The research will set the platform for  which studies can be conducted for improving EPI service utilization in Ghana.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Literature Review</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to stimulate an individual&rsquo;s immune system in order to develop specific immunity to a disease causing organism; and immunization  is the process by which an individual&rsquo;s immune system becomes stimulated against an agent of disease. Immunization can be achieved in an active or passive manner: vaccination is  an active form of immunization, and the two terms are used interchangeably [4](Ansong et al., 2014).</p>\r\n<p>Vaccine preventable infections includes diphtheria, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus, influenza, measles, meningococcus,  mumps, pertussis, pneumococcus, polio, rotavirus, rubella, smallpox, and tetanus. However, with the exception of smallpox, which was declared globally eradicated in 1980,  preventable morbidity from these infections persists. Immunization is essential to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 and reducing childhood mortality by  two-thirds during period of 1990 and 2015 [5]. (Ansong et al., 2014).</p>\r\n<p>Vaccines keep children alive and healthy by protecting them against disease. Immunization is especially important for the hardest to reach families as it can also be a bridge to  other life-saving care for mothers and children in isolated communities (Shengelia, Tandon, Adams, &amp; Murray, 2005).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Immunization Coverage</h3>\r\n<p>Immunization coverage determines the proportion of children who are vaccinated against a particular antigen compared to the number of children expected to be vaccinated.  Immunization coverage is a key measure of the health system performance and output.it is measured at national, regional, district and sub-district levels (Tim, Braa, &amp; Bjune, 2006).</p>\r\n<p>(Ngure, 2015)</p>\r\n<p>Administrative coverage data are collected by monitoring the numbers of doses of the antigen administered to the target population divided by the total estimated number of target  population to the estimate the percentage coverage [6]. This indicate the status of the vaccinations performed by service providers. Surveys are conducted periodically by reviewing  children vaccination histories to identify coverage levels. Surveys are frequently used in conjunction with administrative data. Immunization coverage surveys are also recommended  by W.H.O to be used periodically to verify administrative coverage data [7] (UNICEF, 2009). Immunization coverage rates based on administration data are mainly subject to numerator  (children vaccinated) and denominator (target population) biases. This can lead to an overestimation and underestimation when children vaccinated outside the target age group are  erroneously included in the numerator or when vaccinations are not reported by lower administrative levels such as private sector [8].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Immunization Coverage Levels are Useful in the Following Areas</h3>\r\n<p>âž¢ To monitor the performance of immunization services locally, nationally and internationally.</p>\r\n<p>âž¢ To guide strategies for the eradication, elimination and control of vaccine preventable diseases.</p>\r\n<p>âž¢ To identify areas of immunization systems that may require additional resources and focused attention.</p>\r\n<p>âž¢ To access the need to introduce new vaccines into the immunization system [8].</p>\r\n<p>During 2015, about 86% (116 million) of infants worldwide received 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, protecting them against infectious diseases that can  cause serious illness and disability or be fatal. By 2015, 126 countries had reached at least 90% coverage of DTP3 vaccine. (WHO/UNICEF, 2016)In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million  infants worldwide were not reached with routine immunization services such as DTP3 vaccine. Around 60% of these children live in 10 countries: Angola, the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Ukraine [1] Approximately 17% of deaths in children under five are vaccine preventable. An  estimated 1.5 million children die annually from diseases that can be prevented by immunization. If all children were immunized with existing vaccines, we could save nearly 25  million lives between 2011and 2020. In 2014, an estimated 86 per cent of infants worldwide were vaccinated with three doses of the vaccine required to fully immunize them against  diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3 vaccine) up from 20% in 1980.</p>\r\n<p>Globally, it has been estimated that immunization programs prevent approximately 2.5 million deaths each year. The global eradication of smallpox in 1980, near elimination of  poliomyelitis and global reduction in other vaccine-preventable diseases, are model examples of disease control through immunization [9]. (Ministry of health, 2016).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">The Global vaccine action plan</h3>\r\n<p>The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) is a roadmap to prevent millions of deaths through more equitable access to vaccines. Countries are aiming to achieve vaccination coverage  of at least 90% nationally and at least 80% in every district by 2020. While the GVAP should accelerate control of all vaccine-preventable diseases, polio eradication is set as the  first milestone. It also aims to spur research and development for the next generation of vaccines [10].</p>\r\n<p>WHO is leading efforts to support regions and countries as they adapt the GVAP for implementation. In April 2016, WHO warned that 5 out of the 6 GVAP targets were off-track,  with only 1 target on the introduction of underutilized vaccines showing sufficient progress. This finding was based on the independent assessment report by SAGE.</p>\r\n<p>The GVAP recommends 3 key steps for closing the immunization gap:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Integrating immunization with other health services, such as postnatal care for mothers and babies;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Strengthening health systems so that vaccines continue to be given even in times of crisis; and</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Ensuring that everyone can access vaccines and afford to pay for them.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Key challenges</h3>\r\n<p>Last year, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) identified 5 factors to achieving results in immunization coverage; quality and use of data, community  involvement, better access to immunization services for marginalized and displaced populations, and strong health systems (WHO, 2015b) [10].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Immunization in Ghana</h3>\r\n<p>The Ghana Immunization Programme was established in June 1978 with six (6) antigens - BCG, measles, Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT) and oral polio vaccine for infants and  Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccination for pregnant women to protect against maternal and neonatal tetanus. The establishment of the immunization programme was in response to the National  Health Policy to reduce morbidity and mortality due to Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) which then contributed significantly to both infant and child mortality in the country.  Immunization performance has become a strategic health performance indicator for the entire health sector and is monitored at all levels [2].</p>\r\n<p>The goal of the EPI Programme is to reduce child morbidity, mortality and disability associated with vaccine preventable diseases through the provision of high quality immunization  services. Specifically, the program aims to Achieve 95% coverage for all antigens by 2019; maintain a polio free status, achieve measles/Rubella elimination, and Sustain MNT  elimination.</p>\r\n<p>In the year 2011, Ghana was recognized as one of the countries to have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus. In 2015, the country entered the elimination phase for measles  and rubella (Ministry of health, 2016) Penta-3 has been used as the proxy to measure the improvement in childhood immunization. The national average of Penta-3 coverage increased  from 90% in 2014 to 95.4% in 2015, however 29% (63) of the 216 districts in Ghana, could not achieve the 80% coverage target for Penta 3 coverage in 2015. The Greater Accra region  recorded the highest number (44,487) of unimmunized children [11].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Factors Contributing to Immunization Coverage</h3>\r\n<p>Improving immunization coverage is vital to promoting child health and reducing childhood diseases and deaths. According to WHO, there is a problem with immunization services when  the coverage is below 80% with a dropout rate of above 10%. There are so many factors contributing immunization coverage. Attendance to immunization services are mainly due to; poor  knowledge about immunization, lack of suitable venues and furniture at outreach clinics, financial difficulties, long waiting times, transport difficulties, poorly motivated service  providers and weak inter sectoral collaboration, the timing of immunization sessions, attitude of service providers and fear of side-effects are the major factors contributing to  immunization coverage [12].</p>\r\n<p>(Bosu, Ahelegbe, Edum-Fotwe, Kobina A Bainson, &amp; Kobina Turkson, 1997)</p>\r\n<p>Also, a number of studies have been carried out across the world to find out the significant factors that hinder or increase the likelihood of immunization. Factors that have been  found to be significantly associated with vaccination uptake include maternal education and age, socio- economic status, religion, health services utilization and exposure to the  media. Research has revealed that children in urban areas are more likely to be fully vaccinated than children in rural areas(Mukungwa, 2015). Accessibility to health facilities in  rural areas is poor as compared to urban areas. Studies by Ibnouf et al (2007) and Rup et al (2008) revealed that immunization was significantly higher where distance to a health  facility was lower as the case with urban areas.</p>\r\n<p>Studies have also shown that maternal factors accounted for a high likelihood of child vaccination (Ah, 2007). Mothers with secondary education and higher are better informed and  more empowered hence are more likely than their counterparts with primary or no education to have their children immunized (Makwana &amp; Yadav, 2014). Other studies have revealed that  Immunization compliance increased with mother&rsquo;s economic status. Mothers with high economic status are more likely to immunize their children than mothers with a poor economic  standing (Rahman &amp; Obaida-nasrin, 2010). Immunization compliance is also higher when mothers previously utilized antenatal care services during pregnancy as well as delivered in health  facilities (Etana &amp; Deressa, 2012). In a study carried out by Becker et al (1993) possession of a radio and a television was found to be important determinants of immunization.  Possession of these gadgets increased the likelihood of immunization. [13] in a study in Ghana to find the social determinants of immunization concurred with these results and  concluded that radio and television enhanced access to health information (Dwumoh, Essuman, &amp; Afagbedzi, 2014).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Reasons for Immunization Failure</h3>\r\n<p>Kumar s, et al. [14] revealed that the reasons were lack of transport, fear of side effects and misconception (development of autism)(Kumar et al., 2017). Other studies also found  that inadequate knowledge about immunization and subsequent dose, belief that vaccine causes side-effects, lack of faith in immunization , The major obstacles were busy schedule of  mother, illness of child on the day of immunization and also due to lack of information respectively(Bonu, Rani, &amp; Razum, 2004) With the high under-five mortality in Ghana, full  childhood immunization can mitigate morbidity and mortality through prevention of a vaccine-preventable infection. In an effort to improve immunization in Ghana therefore, it is  imperative to carry out a study of the factors contributing to full immunization of children in order to provide recommendations for policy formulation and designing implementation  programs geared at increasing immunization coverage in the country (Nana &amp; Liverpool, 2000).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Method</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Study Site</h3>\r\n<p>The study was conducted in the Assin North Municipality in the Central Region of Ghana. The district is mainly rural with a population of about 187,949 with the main occupation  been agriculture. For health administrative purposes, the district has been divided into six sub-districts.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Study Design</h3>\r\n<p>The study was a cross sectional study. Data were randomly collected from mothers or caregivers with children 12-23 months of age from 30 randomly selected communities in the  Assin North Municipality.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Size</h3>\r\n<p>Using the sample size calculation methods presented in the WHO immunization coverage cluster survey manual (WHO, 2005), the sample size required was determined using the formula</p>\r\n<p>Nmin = de*z<sup>2</sup>*p*(1-P)/d<sup>2</sup>,</p>\r\n<p>(Where,</p>\r\n<p>Nmi = minimum number of sample size;</p>\r\n<p>De = design effect =1.5;</p>\r\n<p>Z = confidence interval at 95% (standard value of 1.96);</p>\r\n<p>P = estimated prevalence of coverage;</p>\r\n<p>D = with of confidence interval)</p>\r\n<p>Using coverage of 59.2% obtained in the year 2015 for Penta 3 in the Assin North municipality, a design effect of 1.5, a type 1 error of 5%, in the conformity with the standard  WHO methodology, the calculated minimum number of children required would be Nmin=1.5*1.96<sup>2</sup>*0.592*(1-0.592)/(0.05)<sup>2</sup>, Nmin=556. Adjusting for a non-response rate  of 10%, at least a total of 612 mothers with children 12-23 months were determined for the study as sample size.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Data Collection</h3>\r\n<p>The WHO (2005) cluster survey tool adapted into a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. Strategies used to administer the questionnaires included  one-on-one question and answer technique.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Data Processing and Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Data that was generated was coded and entered into the computer for analysis. Data analysis was done using STATA 14 software. The outcome of interest which is the immunizations  status was considered to be fully immunized or partially immunized. The independent variables which included individual factors of the mother, like age, education, occupation  antenatal visit, birth order of the child, knowledge of mother on immunization were looked at. Age of mother was modeled as a categorical variables with categories defined as 0(15-24),  1(25-35), 2(35+) years. Antenatal and visit and birth order were modeled as categorical variables with categories defined as 0 (none),1(once), 3 (thrice), 4 (four or more) and 1  (first child), 2 (2nd or 3rd child), 3 (4th child and above) respectively. The data collected was explored using box plot and other descriptive statistics to check the distribution  of the data and missing data. Univariate analysis in form of frequencies and percentage was performed on the demographic characteristics of the mother and child. Bivariate and  multivariable comparisons were made between immunization status and independent variables using chi square and logistic regression respectively. Chi square was used to determine  the association between immunization status and each of the factors or independent variables. Logistics regression was used to find the association between the independent variables  that show association in the chi square and the child&rsquo;s immunization status independently. This was used to determine which of the variables were strongly associated with child&rsquo;s  immunization status. The odd ratio and P values were recorded. A logistics model was considered for the independent variables. An independent variable was included in the model when  it had p-value of &lt; 0.05. This tested the association between the dependent and independent variables. Associations were considered significant at 95% confidence intervals with  a p-value of less than 0.05.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>A total of 672 mothers or caregivers were interviewed and immunization records on 672 children were reviewed from the 30 clusters in the Assin North municipality. The data also had  complete records on reasons immunization failure.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Demographic Characteristics of Mothers</h3>\r\n<p>The ages of the respondents ranged from 15 to 45 years with a mean of 28.3+ 5.2. Majority of the respondents, 273(40.6%) were within the ages of 25-34 years. The majority ethnic  group of the respondents was Akan constituting about 77.5%. A large proportion of mothers or care givers that&rsquo;s 459(68.3%) had primary education. The major occupation of the mothers  involved in the study was trading representing 289(43.0%). About 615(91.5%) of the respondents had four or more antennal visit during pregnancy period. The table 2 below shows the  complete distribution of the demographic characteristics of the mother or caregiver.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Demographic characteristics of children</h3>\r\n<p>A total of 672 children between the ages of 12-23 months were studied. Out of the 672 children, 52.8% were males. Children between the 2nd and 3rd birth order constituted the  majority with a population of 268 (39.9%). A large proportion of mothers or caregivers 411(61.1%) had a midwife or nurse to attend to them during delivery. Most mothers or caregivers  646 (96.1%) had their cards intact. Majority of the children, 574(85.4%) were fully immunized, 90(13.4%) were partially immunized, and 8(1.2%) were not immunized at all. The table  below shows.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Maternal Knowledge on Immunization and Vaccine Preventable Diseases</h3>\r\n<p>In assessing knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases, participants were asked to mention the various diseases that are prevented by vaccination. 81 (12.1%) could  not mention any disease and 84(12.5%) were able to mention five diseases and above. In the participants response to reasons why children are vaccinated, 390 (58.0%) were able to  mention it prevents them from vaccine preventable diseases, 213(31.7%) knew it makes the children strong whiles 27(4.0%) did not know the reasons for vaccination.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Reasons for Childhood Immunization</h3>\r\n<p>When participants were asked to mention the various vaccines administered to children during vaccination, 201 (29.9%) mentioned measles, 40(6%), tetanus, 126(18.9%) yellow fever,  11(1.6%) hepatitis B, 92(13.7%) Polio, and 81(12.1%) could not mention. Also, 504(75%) knew BCG was the first vaccine given whiles 50(7.4%) did not know the first vaccine given to the  children. When asked about the age at which the first vaccine is given, 255 (38%) mentioned it&rsquo;s given at first week, 167(24.9%), 71 (10.6%), 133(19.8%) mentioned after one week,  first day, after one month respectively. However, 46(6.9%) did not know when it is given. On the knowledge on pentavalent vaccine, a high proportion of the participants,565(84.1%)  said penta1 is given after one month whiles,15(2.2%),22(3.3%),70(10.4%) it is given at six weeks or more, first day, after one week respectively. also,435(64.7%) knew the interval  between pentavalent vaccine is 1 month whiles others knew they the intervals were 8(1.2%),181(26.9%) one week, more than one month respectively. However,48(7.1%) did not know the  interval between pentavalent vaccination. The name of the last vaccine given to children were asked, 143(19.9%) knew it is given at nigh month, 231(34.5%) knew it its 8months,  172(25.6%) knew is one year whiles 114(17.0%) did not know when last vaccine is given.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when asked of their source of knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases, a high proportion of the participants 512(76.2%) had their source of knowledge  from health centers whiles 51(7.6%), 13(1.9%), 30(4.5%), 32(4.8%), had their knowledge from family members, friends, bookings and reading material and radio and television respectively.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Factors Influencing Immunization Status of a Child</h3>\r\n<p>Different variables assumed to be associated with immunization status of the child were included in the study. These variables include socio demographic characteristics of mothers  or care givers of the child and characteristics of the child, the mother or care givers knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases. These factors associated with the  child&rsquo;s immunization completion were analyzed using logistic regression.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Demographic Characteristics of Mothers or Caregivers</h3>\r\n<p>The association of mother&rsquo;s demographic characteristics with immunization status of the children was assessed using bivariate and multivariate analysis by chi square and logistic  regression analysis. Mothers source of knowledge, and attendant at birth, were significantly associated with immunization status of the child in a bivariate analysis using chi square  with a p- value of &lt; 0.05.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Comparison of Mothers&rsquo; Characteristics and Immunization Status</h3>\r\n<p>In a bivariate analysis using logistic regression, mothers between the ages of 25- 34 were 1.34(95% CI: 0.83-2.186) times more likely to fully immunized their children as compared  to mothers with the age group 15-24. The odds of a child being immunized fully by mothers within the age 35 and above is 1.35(95% CI: 0.76, 2.40) times compared to those within the  reference group 15-24. However, when the other maternal characteristics were adjusted for in a multivariate analysis, mother&rsquo;s age was no more significant determinant of immunization  status of the child.</p>\r\n<p>The odd of a child being fully immunized by a mother, who is a Ga, Ewe, Hausa or any other ethnic group is 7.33(95%CI:99,54.01), 0.66(95%CI:0.35,1.26), 2.50(95% C,0.32,19.30),  1.50(95% CI:0.44,5.05) times the of a mother who is a Akan respectively. When all the other maternal factors were adjusted for, ethnicity was not still significantly associated  with immunization status. This can be seen in table 8. Educational status of the mother was significantly associated with immunization status of the child. A child with a mother  with a primary level education 1.15(95% CI: 0.60, 2.2) times more likely to be fully immunized as compared with an illiterate mother. A mother with a secondary education is also  1.47(95% CI: 0.64, 3.37) times more likely to be completely immunize their children while the odds of being fully immunized by a mother with tertiary education is 0.74(95%CI: 0.24,  2.37) times compared to the illiterate ones. Upon adjusting for all other maternal variables, maternal educational to levels, were not significantly associated with immunization  status of the child. showed in table 8.</p>\r\n<p>Mother&rsquo;s occupation was also significantly associated with a child&rsquo;s immunization status. The odds of completely immunizing a child by mothers who were traders, farmers, public  servant or involved in other occupations is 1.21(95%CI:0.21,4.04), 1.83(95%CI:0.94,3.55), 1.43(95%CI:0.55,3.71) and 2.01(95%CI:0.94,4.31) times compared to mothers who are not  employed. After adjust for all other maternal characteristics, mothers who are traders were 1.83(95%CI:0.89,3.75) times more likely to completely vaccinate their children as  compared with the unemployed mothers while the mothers who are farmers, public servants and other occupations were no more significantly associated with a child&rsquo;s immunization  status(table).</p>\r\n<p>Mothers with prenatal visits of twice and four or more were 2.44(95% CI: 0.36, 16.55) and 2.63(95% CI: 0.79, 8.70) times more likely to fully immunize their compared to mothers who  do not have any antennal care visits during pregnancy. Those with antenatal visits of once or thrice had odds ratio that were not significant When the other maternal characteristics  were held constant, mothers with antennal visits of thrice or four or more were 3.9(95% CI:0.60,23.17), 2.70(95% CI 0.73,9.93) times more likely to completely vaccinate their children  compared to their counterparts with no antenatal care visit as seen in table 6.</p>\r\n<p>Mothers with at least moderate knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases were 4.27(95%CI 2.03,7.81) times more likely to fully immunized their children as compared  to those with low knowledge. When adjusted for other variables, mothers&rsquo; knowledge was still significantly associated with immunization status with odds of 2.74(95%CI :1.45,5.18)  times those with low knowledge levels.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Childs Characteristics</h3>\r\n<p>Appendix 3 shows the frequencies and percentages of the immunization status of the children between the ages of 12-23 months with respect to the child&rsquo;s characteristics. The table  indicates that, out of 98 children who were partially immunized, 54% were females. About 62.0% of those who were fully immunized were males. About 33.2%, 39.9%, and 26.9% of the  children who were fully immunized were within the birth orders, first, 2nd to 3rd, and 4th and above respectively. About 61% of children were partially immunized had a nurse or  midwife to deliver the child while 61.1 % of those fully immunized were delivered by nurse or midwife. About 67% of those who were partially immunized children had their vaccination  cards while the rest do not have. On the other hand, about 98% of those fully immunized children had their immunization card. Attendance at the birth and retention of cards were only  characteristics that were significantly associated with immunization status.</p>\r\n<p>From table 7, attendance at birth is a significant determinant of immunization status. However, the adjusted odd ratio indicates that the odds of a child being fully immunized  as a results of being delivered by a TBA is reduced by 21.8% as compared to those who did not have any health personnel to deliver the child. The odds of being fully immunized when  the child was delivered by nurse/midwife or doctor is 9.51(95% CI: 1.55-58.18) or 3.5 (95% CI: 1.92, 95.09) times those who were not delivered by and health personnel respectively.  Immunization card retention is significant determinant of immunization status. The odds of being fully immunized by a child who had an immunization a card is 1.07(95% CI .36, 3.12)  times those who do not have immunization cards. When all other characteristics were held constant, the odds of a child being fully immunized 1.24 times than those without immunization  cards.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Reasons for Immunization Failure among Partially and Non-Immunized Children</h3>\r\n<p>The respondents who could not complete the routine immunization schedule for their children were asked for there their reasons for immunization failure. A lot of reasons were  given as indicated as given. out of 672 respondents, about 33.5% could not complete the immunization for their children because they were not aware of the need for immunization.  The second reason given by 32.9% was that they were not aware of the need to return for the subsequent immunizations. Some 16.7% of the respondents did not know where to go for the  next vaccination. About 56.3% were not motivated to come for immunization because their vaccinations were postponed until another time hence their inability to complete their  immunization. Place of immunization, time of immunization inconvenient, vaccinator absent, family problems including child been sick were the reasons given by 17.6%, 20.1%, 15.3%  and 18.5% of the respondents respectively.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Proportion of Children That Have Been Fully Immunized in the Municipality</h3>\r\n<p>The aim of the study was to find out factors contributing to low coverage immunization in Assin North Municipality. Based on immunization card and recall, 85.8% children were  fully vaccinated, and 14.6% were not fully vaccinated in the year 2016. The pentavalent3 coverage was 91.7% which is above the 2015 WHO/UNICEF coverage of 86% worldwide [1]. The OPV3  vaccine coverage was the same as coverage of the Pentavalent3 vaccine. The Measles coverage was higher than the Yellow Fever vaccine coverage which under normal circumstance should  be the same. The higher coverage of OPV3 and Pentavalent 3 is due to frequent mop ups and home visits by the community health nurses.</p>\r\n<p>Beside this, the current finding is higher than the immunization coverage for Penta from 2013, 2014, and 2015 74.7%, 59.3%, and 59.2% coverage respectively. This difference may be  due to the under reporting of health and health related indicators data from some areas. From the total interviewed mothers or care givers, 646 (96.1%) mothers showed the vaccination  card of their children. From the card most children took BCG and OPV1 vaccines, but only 14.6% did not finished the immunization.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge of Mothers /Caregivers on Immunization and Vaccine Preventable Diseases</h3>\r\n<p>The study also assessed mothers&rsquo;or care givers knowledge on vaccination and vaccine preventable disease. About 90.1% mothers heard about childhood immunization and vaccine  preventable diseases, but only 58.0% of them mentioned that vaccination is use to prevent disease. However, 31% of the respondents had a misconception that vaccination makes their  children strong. Even though the percentage with knowledge on the importance of vaccination was average, majority of the children had received some form of vaccination. This may be  due to the fact that, immunization is free in Ghana and health workers send vaccines to the doorsteps of the people in the municipality on outreaches and home visits for eligible  children. The study also revealed few mothers (12.5%) were able to mention that vaccines prevent 5 or more diseases. The most frequently mentioned diseases were Measles and  Poliomyelitis. This may be largely due to National Immunization Days (NIDs) And Measles Supplemental immunization Activities (SIAs) Campaigns. Knowledge on various vaccines,  when they are administered; the intervals between the various doses of each vaccine and the age at which vaccination should be completed was very low as in most cases more than  6.6% do not have any idea about the question. This contrast a study conducted by Belachew, 2011 that, mothers who had knowledge on vaccine and vaccine preventable diseases are  more likely to fully immunize their children.</p>\r\n<p>Surprisingly, about 76.2% of the respondents received their education from health centers during immunization sessions. This raises the question on the kind of education given  to mothers during immunization sessions. Though, radio and television role in educating the public on health, only 4.8% of the respondents had their source of knowledge from these  sources. This may be due to the fact that education on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases are less discuss on the radio and television.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Factors Affecting Immunization Status of a Child</h3>\r\n<p>The study also assessed factors affecting immunization status of children by grouping them into categories, partially immunized and fully immunized. Maternal and child  characteristics affecting immunization status of the children were analyzed separately and factors associated to the immunization status were identified by bivariate and multivariate  analysis using chi square and logistics regression.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the bivariate analysis, maternal age. ethnicity, education, occupation and antenatal clinics visits were the maternal characteristics that showed significant association  with the immunization status of the child. Older mothers were more likely to fully immunize their children than their younger counterparts. Maternal age and immunization status of  children has been a controversial issue for researchers. Some studies say middle age mothers are more likely to immunized their children [5], while some say the younger ones are more  likely to complete their immunization [15]. Also mothers with higher educational status were more likely to complete their immunization schedule of their children as compared to their  counterparts who are illiterates. Studies conducted in the past [16] show there is a significant association between maternal educational status and immunization status of the child,  Mothers or caregivers who have one beyond secondary education and higher are better informed and more empowered hence are more likely than their counterparts with primary or no  education to have their children [17]. In this study, mothers with primary education, secondary education and tertiary education level of education were 1.2,1.5,0.75 times respectively  more likely to fully immunized their children as compared to their counter parts illiterates. Mothers who were farmers, traders, and public servant and other occupations were 1.83,  2.21, 1.43, 2.01 more likely to fully immunized their children than their un employed counterparts. Also, mothers who had two or more ANC visits were more likely to fully immunized  their children. Mothers with two, three, four or more were 2.44, 3.11, 2.6 times respectively are more likely to fully immunized their children than those who attended ANC once or  not at all. This is in contrast with the finding by [9] who found ANC follow up have significant associated with the completion of vaccination by adjusted odds ratio of 1.621.  However, this support the finding of Rahman and Obaida nasrin in Bangladesh who found that mothers with five or more visits were more likely to completely immunized their children [5].</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, mothers with moderate knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases were 5.27 times more likely to complete the immunization schedule of their children.  This is in agreement with a study conducted by Belachew in Addis Ababa and Oluwadare in Nigeria [16].</p>\r\n<p>In the Multivariate analysis where all the significant maternal characteristics were put together in a single model, knowledge and attendant at birth was significantly associated  with immunization status. Maternal age, ethnicity, occupation, antenatal care visits were no longer significant maternal factors for immunization status. This confirms the findings  of [16] who said, these factors were not significantly associated with immunization status. Maternal knowledge and education were still significant his confirms Ibnouf, et al. studies  that showed education to be significant after adjusting for other variables [18].</p>\r\n<p>Bivariate analysis of the child&rsquo;s characteristics revealed that the only significant determinants of immunization status are attendants at birth. Also, in the multivariate  analysis, attendant at birth was significantly associated with immunization status. The sex of the child, birth order and retention of immunization cards were not significantly  associated with immunization status. This is in contrast with a study that found that males are more likely to be immunized due to gender inequality [9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Reasons for Immunization Failure</h3>\r\n<p>This research also tried to find out the reasons for immunization failure. Ninetyeight (98) out of 672 respondents could not fully immunize their children as scheduled for various  reasons. The most frequent reason was mothers been too busy (33.5%). This may be due to the fact that most of the mothers are traders and farmers. About 33.5% of the participants  attributed their inability to immunize their children to not aware of the need to return for subsequent immunization. This may confirm the fact that radio and television are not  educating people much on health and also health workers are not educating people enough during immunization sessions. About 56.3% also attributed postponement till another time as  their major challenge. This may make them forget or the rescheduled time may be inconvenient to them. The other reason which represents about 20.1% of the respondents was place and  time not convenient. Sometimes it difficult to get money for transport and also walking through bad weather or forested areas are nightmares for mothers, therefore they will not  come for immunization. About 5.6% said their failure was due to family problems including the sickness of the mother. Fear of side reactions like swelling, fever, and headaches  accounted for about 3.9% of the respondent&rsquo;s reason for failure to send their children for immunization. Some of the mother&rsquo;s about 6.2% said the place and time for the immunization  was unknown to them while 3.1% said either the child was sick was brought for immunization. A few, about 2.9% claimed the vaccination center was too far from their homes or have heard  of rumors of effects immunization which put them off. Only 0.6% of the respondents attributed to their failure to unavailability of vaccines. This supported the findings of Ayano&rsquo;s  study [9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Proportion of Children that are Fully Immunized</h3>\r\n<p>Fully immunized children between ages 12-23 months in the Assin north municipality was 85.4% which is far above the reported coverage for the years 2013,2014, and 2015. suprisingly,  pentavenlent3 coverage which is use as proxy indicator was 91.7% which is also above the who and national target Maternal knowledge on immunization and vaccine preventable diseases  were low as majority of the mothers or caregivers interviewed had a knowledge score below 34%.only 9% of them had a score above 67%.about 58.0% knew immunization protect children  against childhood immunizable diseases. Knowledge of the names prevented by vaccines was high about 88.0% as participants were able to mention at least one vaccine and the disease  that it prevents. However, the names of the various vaccines administered in children, the interval between doses of each vaccine, the age at which the vaccine is given and when  I end were low as more than 40% of the respondents did not know the correct answers to the questions.</p>\r\n<p>The maternal and care givers characteristics that were significantly associated with immunization status of the child age, educational level, attendant at birth, occupation and  knowledge and educational status. they were significant in the bivariate analysis.in the multivariate analysis, only attendant at birth was significantly associated with childhood  immunization.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Reasons for Immunization Failure</h3>\r\n<p>Reasons accounting for routine immunization failure were; Mother too busy, Unaware of the need to come for subsequent doses of vaccine, Time and venue of immunization not to  convenient, Postponement of vaccination until another time, Wrong ideas of contraindications.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Recommendations</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Immunisation coverage</h3>\r\n<p>There is some data discrepancies in the reports generated from the field and what is entered into the dhims2.this in a way have accounted for low coverage. Therefore,</p>\r\n<p>âž¢ The community health workers should reconcile all their data from the field before they submit to the next level.</p>\r\n<p>âž¢ The district director should constitute a data validation teams at the various levels so that the under reporting of data will be minimized.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge on vaccine preventable diseases and immunization</h3>\r\n<p>Health education on immunisation should be intensified across all the health facilities in the municipalities.

Anxiety is dread in  anticipation of a future menace or an imminent but diffuse and unspecified danger, usually imagined or exaggerated [1]. The mental state of anxiety (and the  concomitant hypervigilance) has physiological complements. It is accompanied by short-term dysphoria and physical symptoms of stress and tension, such as  sweating, palpitations, tachycardia, hyperventilation, angina, tensed muscle tone, and elevated blood pressure (arousal). It is common for anxiety disorders  to include obsessive thoughts, compulsive and ritualistic acts, restlessness, fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating [2-4].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Personality Disorders and Anxiety</h3>\r\n<p>Patients with personality disorders are often anxious. Narcissists, for instance, are preoccupied with the need to secure social approval or attention  (Narcissistic Supply) [5]. The narcissist cannot control this need and the attendant anxiety because he requires external feedback to regulate his labile  sense of self-worth. This dependence makes most narcissists irritable. They fly into rages and have a very low threshold of frustration [6].</p>\r\n<p>Subjects suffering from certain personality disorders (e.g., Histrionic, Borderline, Narcissistic, Avoidant, Schizotypal) resemble patients who suffer from  Panic Attacks and Social Phobia (another anxiety disorder) [7]. They are terrified of being embarrassed or criticized in public. Consequently, they fail to  function well in various settings (social, occupational, interpersonal, etc.) [8-11].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Narcissism, Obsession-Compulsion, and Anxiety</h3>\r\n<p>Anxiety Disorders - and especially Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - are often misdiagnosed as Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).</p>\r\n<p>Anxiety is uncontrollable and excessive apprehension. Anxiety disorders usually come replete with obsessive thoughts, compulsive and ritualistic acts,  restlessness, fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and somatic manifestations (such as an increased heart rate, sweating, or, in Panic Attacks,  chest pains) [12].</p>\r\n<p>By definition, narcissists are anxious for social approval or attention (Narcissistic Supply). The narcissist cannot control this need and the attendant  anxiety because he requires external feedback to regulate his labile sense of self-worth. This dependence makes most narcissists irritable [13]. They fly into  rages and have a very low threshold of frustration [14-15].</p>\r\n<p>Like patients who suffer from Panic Attacks and Social Phobia (another anxiety disorder), narcissists are terrified of being embarrassed or criticised in  public [16]. Consequently, most narcissists fail to function well in various settings (social, occupational, romantic, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>The personality disordered often develop obsessions and compulsions. Like sufferers of anxiety disorders, narcissists and compulsive-obsessives, for instance,  are perfectionists and preoccupied with the quality of their performance and the level of their competence [17]. As the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  (DSM-IV-TR, p. 473) puts it, GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) patients (especially children):</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip; (A) re typically overzealous in seeking approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and their other worries&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>This could apply equally well to subjects with the Narcissistic or the Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. Both classes of patients - those suffering  from anxiety disorders and those tormented by personality disorders - are paralyzed by the fear of being judged as imperfect or lacking [18-20]. Narcissists as  well as patients with anxiety disorders constantly fail to measure up to an inner, harsh, and sadistic critic and a grandiose, inflated self-image.</p>\r\n<p>From my book &ldquo;Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The narcissistic solution is to avoid comparison and competition altogether and to demand special treatment. The narcissist&rsquo;s sense of entitlement is  incommensurate with the narcissist&rsquo;s true accomplishments. He withdraws from the rat race because he does not deem his opponents, colleagues, or peers worthy  of his efforts [21].</p>\r\n<p>As opposed to narcissists, patients with Anxiety Disorders are invested in their work and their profession. To be exact, they are over-invested [22]. Their  preoccupation with perfection is counter-productive and, ironically, renders them underachievers.</p>\r\n<p>It is easy to mistake the presenting symptoms of certain anxiety disorders with pathological narcissism. Both types of patients are worried about social  approbation and seek it actively. Both present a haughty or impervious facade to the world. Both are dysfunctional and weighed down by a history of personal  failure on the job and in the family. But the narcissist is ego-syntonic: he is proud and happy of who he is. The anxious patient is distressed and is looking  for help and a way out of his or her predicament. Hence the differential diagnosis&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Effects of Abuse</h3>\r\n<p>Repeated abuse has long lasting pernicious and traumatic effects such as panic attacks, hypervigilance, sleep disturbances, flashbacks (intrusive memories),  suicidal ideation, and psychosomatic symptoms. The victims experience shame, depression, anxiety, embarrassment, guilt, humiliation, abandonment, and an  enhanced sense of vulnerability [23].</p>\r\n<p>C-PTSD (Complex PTSD) has been proposed as a new mental health diagnosis by Dr. Judith Herman of Harvard University to account for the impact of extended  periods of trauma and abuse.</p>\r\n<p>In <b>&ldquo;Stalking - An Overview of the Problem&rdquo;</b> [Can J Psychiatry 1998; 43:473&ndash;476], authors Karen M Abrams and Gail Erlick Robinson write: &ldquo;Initially,  there is often much denial by the victim. Over time, however, the stress begins to erode the victim&rsquo;s life and psychological brutalisation results. Sometimes  the victim develops an almost fatal resolve that, inevitably, one day she will be murdered. Victims, unable to live a normal life, describe feeling stripped of  self-worth and dignity. Personal control and resources, psychosocial development, social support, premorbid personality traits, and the severity of the stress  may all influence how the victim experiences and responds to it Victims stalked by ex-lovers may experience additional guilt and lowered self-esteem for  perceived poor judgement in their relationship choices [24]. Many victims become isolated and deprived of support when employers or friends withdraw after  also being subjected to harassment or are cut off by the victim in order to protect them. Other tangible consequences include financial losses from quitting  jobs, moving, and buying expensive security equipment in an attempt to gain privacy. Changing homes and jobs results in both material losses and loss of  self-respect&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Surprisingly, verbal, psychological, and emotional abuse have the same effects as the physical variety [Psychology Today, September/October 2000 issue, p.24].  Abuse of all kinds also interferes with the victim&rsquo;s ability to work. Abrams and Robinson wrote this [in &ldquo;Occupational Effects of Stalking&rdquo;, Can J Psychiatry  2002;47:468&ndash;472].</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip; (B) being stalked by a former partner may affect a victim&rsquo;s ability to work in 3 ways. First, the stalking behaviours often interfere directly with the  ability to get to work (for example, flattening tires or other methods of preventing leaving the home). Second, the workplace may become an unsafe location if  the offender decides to appear. Third, the mental health effects of such trauma may result in forgetfulness, fatigue, lowered concentration, and disorganisation.  These factors may lead to the loss of employment, with accompanying loss of income, security, and status&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Still, it is hard to generalise. Victims are not a uniform lot. In some cultures, abuse is commonplace and accepted as a legitimate mode of communication,  a sign of love and caring, and a boost to the abuser&rsquo;s self-image. In such circumstances, the victim is likely to adopt the norms of society and avoid serious  trauma [25].</p>\r\n<p>Deliberate, cold-blooded, and premeditated torture has worse and longer-lasting effects than abuse meted out by the abuser in rage and loss of self-control.  The existence of a loving and accepting social support network is another mitigating factor. Finally, the ability to express negative emotions safely and to  cope with them constructively is crucial to healing.</p>\r\n<p>Typically, by the time the abuse reaches critical and all-pervasive proportions, the abuser had already, spider-like, isolated his victim from family,  friends, and colleagues. She is catapulted into a nether land, cult-like setting where reality itself dissolves into a continuing nightmare.</p>\r\n<p>When she emerges on the other end of this wormhole, the abused woman (or, more rarely, man) feels helpless, self-doubting, worthless, stupid, and a guilty  failure for having botched her relationship and &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; her &ldquo;family&rdquo;. In an effort to regain perspective and avoid embarrassment, the victim denies the  abuse or minimises it.</p>\r\n<p>No wonder that survivors of abuse tend to be clinically depressed, neglect their health and personal appearance, and succumb to boredom, rage, and impatience.  Many end up abusing prescription drugs or drinking or otherwise behaving recklessly.</p>\r\n<p>Some victims even develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>\r\n<p>Contrary to popular misconceptions, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Acute Stress Disorder (or Reaction) are not typical responses to prolonged  abuse. They are the outcomes of sudden exposure to severe or extreme stressors (stressful events). Yet, some victims whose life or body have been directly and  unequivocally threatened by an abuser react by developing these syndromes. PTSD is, therefore, typically associated with the aftermath of physical and sexual  abuse in both children and adults.</p>\r\n<p>This is why another mental health diagnosis, C-PTSD (Complex PTSD) has been proposed by Dr. Judith Herman of Harvard University to account for the impact  of extended periods of trauma and abuse.</p>\r\n<p>One&rsquo;s (or someone else&rsquo;s) looming death, violation, personal injury, or powerful pain are sufficient to provoke the behaviours, cognitions, and emotions  that together are known as PTSD [26]. Even learning about such mishaps may be enough to trigger massive anxiety responses.</p>\r\n<p>The first phase of PTSD involves incapacitating and overwhelming fear. The victim feels like she has been thrust into a nightmare or a horror movie. She is  rendered helpless by her own terror. She keeps re-living the experience through recurrent and intrusive visual and auditory hallucinations (&ldquo;flashbacks&rdquo;) or  dreams. In some flashbacks, the victim completely lapses into a dissociative state and physically re-enacts the event while being thoroughly oblivious to her  whereabouts.</p>\r\n<p>In an attempt to suppress this constant playback and the attendant exaggerated startle response (jumpiness), the victim tries to avoid all stimuli  associated, however indirectly, with the traumatic event. Many develop full-scale phobias (agoraphobia, claustrophobia, fear of heights, aversion to specific  animals, objects, modes of transportation, neighbourhoods, buildings, occupations, weather, and so on) [27].</p>\r\n<p>Most PTSD victims are especially vulnerable on the anniversaries of their abuse. They try to avoid thoughts, feelings, conversations, activities, situations,  or people who remind them of the traumatic occurrence (&ldquo;triggers&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>This constant hypervigilance and arousal, sleep disorders (mainly insomnia), the irritability (&ldquo;short fuse&rdquo;), and the inability to concentrate and complete  even relatively simple tasks erode the victim&rsquo;s resilience. Utterly fatigued, most patients manifest protracted periods of numbness, automatism, and, in radical  cases, near-catatonic posture. Response times to verbal cues increase dramatically. Awareness of the environment decreases, sometimes dangerously so. The  victims are described by their nearest and dearest as &ldquo;zombies&rdquo;, &ldquo;machines&rdquo;, or &ldquo;automata&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The victims appear to be sleepwalking, depressed, dysphoric, anhedonic (not interested in anything and find pleasure in nothing). They report feeling  detached, emotionally absent, estranged, and alienated. Many victims say that their &ldquo;life is over&rdquo; and expect to have no career, family, or otherwise meaningful  future.</p>\r\n<p>The victim&rsquo;s family and friends complain that she is no longer capable of showing intimacy, tenderness, compassion, empathy, and of having sex (due to her  post-traumatic &ldquo;frigidity&rdquo;). Many victims become paranoid, impulsive, reckless, and self-destructive. Others somatise their mental problems and complain of  numerous physical ailments. They all feel guilty, shameful, humiliated, desperate, hopeless, and hostile.</p>\r\n<p>PTSD need not appear immediately after the harrowing experience. It can &ndash; and often is &ndash; delayed by days or even months. It lasts more than one month  (usually much longer). Sufferers of PTSD report subjective distress (the manifestations of PTSD are ego-dystonic). Their functioning in various settings &ndash; job  performance, grades at school, sociability &ndash; deteriorates markedly.</p>\r\n<p>The DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) criteria for diagnosing PTSD are far too restrictive. PTSD seems to also develop in the wake of verbal and  emotional abuse and in the aftermath of drawn out traumatic situations (such a nasty divorce). Hopefully, the text will be adapted to reflect this sad reality.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Roles of Therapy</h3>\r\n<p>Victims of abuse in all its forms &ndash; verbal, emotional, financial, physical, and sexual &ndash; are often disorientated. They require not only therapy to heal their  emotional wounds, but also practical guidance and topical education. At first, the victim is, naturally, distrustful and even hostile. The therapist or case  worker must establish confidence and rapport painstakingly and patiently.</p>\r\n<p>The therapeutic alliance requires constant reassurance that the environment and treatment modalities chosen are safe and supportive. This is not easy to do,  partly because of objective factors such as the fact that the records and notes of the therapist are not confidential. The offender can force their disclosure  in a court of law simply by filing a civil lawsuit against the survivor.</p>\r\n<p>The first task is to legitimise and validate the victim&rsquo;s fears. This is done by making clear to her that she is not responsible for her abuse or guilty for  what happened. Victimisation is the abuser&rsquo;s fault &ndash; it is not the victim&rsquo;s choice. Victims do not seek abuse &ndash; although, admittedly some of them keep finding  abusive partners and forming relationships of co-dependence. Facing, reconstructing, and reframing the traumatic experiences is a crucial and indispensable  first phase.</p>\r\n<p>The therapist should present the victim with her own ambivalence and the ambiguity of her messages &ndash; but this ought to be done gently, non-judgementally,  and without condemnation. The more willing and able the abuse survivor is to confront the reality of her mistreatment (and the offender), the stronger she would  feel and the less guilty.</p>\r\n<p>Typically, the patient&rsquo;s helplessness decreases together with her self-denial. Her self-esteem as well as her sense of self-worth stabilise. The therapist  should emphasise the survivor&rsquo;s strengths and demonstrate how they can save her from a recurrence of the abuse or help her cope with it and with her abuser.</p>\r\n<p>Education is an a important tool in this process of recovery. The patient should be made aware of the prevalence and nature of violence against women and  stalking, their emotional and physical effects, warning signs and red flags, legal redresses, coping strategies, and safety precautions.</p>\r\n<p>The therapist or social worker should provide the victim with lists of contacts &ndash; help organisations, law enforcement agencies, other women in her condition,  domestic violence shelters, and victims&rsquo; support groups both online and in her neighbourhood or city. Knowledge empowers and reduces the victim&rsquo;s sense of  isolation and worthlessness.</p>\r\n<p>Helping the survivor regain control of her life is the over-riding goal of the entire therapeutic process. With this aim in mind, she should be encouraged to  re-establish contact with family, friends, colleagues, and the community at large. The importance of a tightly-knit social support network cannot be exaggerated.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally, after a period of combined tutoring, talk therapy, and (anti-anxiety or antidepressant) medications, the survivor will self-mobilise and emerge from  the experience more resilient and assertive and less gullible and self-deprecating.</p>\r\n<p>Statistically, the majority of abuse victims are female and most abusers are male. Still, we should bear in mind that there are male victims and female  offenders as well.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally, after a period of combined tutoring, talk therapy, and (anti-anxiety or antidepressant) medications, the survivor will self-mobilise and emerge  from the experience more resilient and assertive and less gullible and self-deprecating.</p>\r\n<p>But therapy is not always a smooth ride. Victims of abuse are saddled with emotional baggage which often provokes even in the most experienced therapists  reactions of helplessness, rage, fear and guilt. Countertransference is common: therapists of both genders identify with the victim and resent her for making  them feel impotent and inadequate (for instance, in their role as &ldquo;social protectors&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>Reportedly, to fend off anxiety and a sense of vulnerability (&ldquo;it could have been me, sitting there!&rdquo;), female therapists involuntarily blame the &ldquo;spineless&rdquo;  victim and her poor judgement for causing the abuse. Some female therapists concentrate on the victim&rsquo;s childhood (rather than her harrowing present) or accuse  her of overreacting.</p>\r\n<p>Male therapists may assume the mantle of the &ldquo;chivalrous rescuer&rdquo;, the &ldquo;knight in the shining armour&rdquo; &ndash; thus, inadvertently upholding the victim&rsquo;s view of  herself as immature, helpless, in need of protection, vulnerable, weak, and ignorant. The male therapist may be driven to prove to the victim that not all men  are &ldquo;beasts&rdquo;, that there are &ldquo;good&rdquo; specimen (like himself). If his (conscious or unconscious) overtures are rejected, the therapist may identify with the  abuser and re-victimise or pathologise his patient.</p>\r\n<p>Many therapists tend to over identify with the victim and rage at the abuser, at the police, and at &ldquo;the system&rdquo;. They expect the victim to be equally  aggressive even as they broadcast to her how powerless, unjustly treated, and discriminated against she is. If she &ldquo;fails&rdquo; to externalise aggression and show  assertiveness, they feel betrayed and disappointed.</p>\r\n<p>Most therapists react impatiently to the victim&rsquo;s perceived co-dependence, unclear messages, and on-off relationship with her tormentor. Such rejection by  the therapist may lead to a premature termination of the therapy, well before the victim learned how to process anger and cope with her low self-esteem and  learned helplessness.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, there is the issue of personal security. Some ex-lovers and ex-spouses are paranoid stalkers and, therefore, dangerous. The therapist may even be  required to testify against the offender in a court of law. Therapists are human and fear for their own safety and the security of their loved ones. This  affects their ability to help the victim.</p>\r\n<p>This is not to say that therapy invariably fails. On the contrary, most therapeutic alliances succeed to teach the victim to accept and transform her  negative emotions into positive energy and to competently draw and implement realistic plans of action while avoiding the pitfalls of the past.

For example, according  to Nestel, consuming one to four servings of fish per week significantly prevented coronary heart disease in comparison to no fish intake [1]. Similar findings  were reported by Orencia AJ, et al., who examined fish consumption and susceptibility to stroke in a sample of middle aged men and reported that men who ate the  highest levels of fish had a higher age adjusted death rate from stroke compared to men who ate moderate to small amounts of fish [2]. Low quantities of omega-3  fatty acids, such as two to three servings per week or two fish oil capsules per day, have also been found to decrease the prevalence of unexpected deaths  caused by irregular heartbeats, as well as reduce systolic blood pressure by 5 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) [3,4]. Though fish consumption does increase  omega-3 fatty acid intake, fish with high mercury levels have been shown to negatively affect health outcomes. The consumption of fish with high levels of  mercury may result in mercury toxicity, which decreases the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids and increases blood pressure [5]. Nahab et al. examined mercury  levels in deep fried fish (with and without breading) compared to raw fish [6]. They found that mercury levels were higher in fried fish. Mercury increased  by 45% in breaded fried fish and by 75% in fish fried without breading. The investigators also reported that the median mercury levels from fried breaded and  non-breaded fish were twice as high for African American men and women compared to White men and women. Omega-3 fatty acids in fish have been shown to have  favorable effects on cardiovascular disease in Caucasians, but the effects on African Americans&rsquo; cardiac health is not as promising. For example, Nahab examined  racial and geographic differences in fish consumption among African American and Caucasian men and women and found that although African Americans ate  significantly more fish, they had significantly less omega 3 fatty acids than Caucasians [7]. The beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids may differ  depending on the way the fish is prepared. Since many African Americans prepare their fish through frying, this method of cooking may decrease the beneficial  effects of omega 3 fatty acids on health outcomes in this group [7,8]. The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of fish preparation to  predict cardiovascular reactivity to stress in African American men and women. It was hypothesized that fish preparation would significantly predict  cardiovascular activity. Specifically, consumption of fish prepared in a healthy manner (grilling and baking) would be associated with lower cardiovascular  activity and consumption of fish prepared in an unhealthy manner (frying) would be associated with greater cardiovascular activity.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Method</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Study Design</h3>\r\n<p>The ability of fish preparation to predict cardiovascular activity was examined. The cross-sectional study protocol was approved by the University&rsquo;s  Intuitional Review Board. Upon completion of the study, participants were given course credit for their participation.</p>\r\n<p><b>Subjects:</b> One hundred and thirty-one African-American students (30 men and 101 women) between the ages of 18 and 28 years participated in the study.  All students were screened for cardiovascular disorders and prescription medications that could interfere with the functioning of the cardiovascular system.  Students under the age of 18, had cardiovascular disorders, and/or who were taking prescribed medications were not allowed to participate in the study. For  fish preparation, 11 participants reported eating grilled fish, 14 participants reported eating baked fish, 39 participants reported eating fried fish and 71  reported eating fish that is fried and prepared other ways. The participants were citizens of the United States and were recruited from classes in the  Psychology department. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the University Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained  from all participants included in the study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Procedures</h3>\r\n<p>After the informed consent form was read and signed, cardiovascular activity was non-invasively measured as the participants viewed the 3-minute video  recorded scene on digital versatile disc (DVD). Cardiovascular measures were taken prior to the scene (pre-stressor period), during the scene (stressor period),  and while the participant recovered from the scene (recovery period). Each period lasted three minutes and measurements were taken 80 seconds into the period.  The participants completed the seafood survey after all cardiovascular measures were obtained.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Measures</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular Functioning: A Hypertension Diagnostics Pulse wave CR 2000 cardiovascular profiling instrument was used to non-invasively assess BMI and  cardiovascular responses (heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, mean arterial pressure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure). The oscillometric method  was used to determine the measures of blood pressure. In addition, cardiac ejection time measured from blood pressure waveforms were used to obtain measures of  stroke volume and cardiac output. To provide a clearer picture of the participants&rsquo; overall physiological wellbeing, the cardiovascular measures were collapsed  across the three periods.</p>\r\n<p><b>Stressor:</b> Cardiovascular activity was measured as the particpants viewed the racially noxious scene on DVD. The scene depicted the horrendous  conditions that Africans experienced as they were transported to America for slavery.</p>\r\n<p><b>Seafood Survey:</b> A seafood survey was used to assess how the consumed fish was prepared (grilled, baked, canned, or fried).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Data Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Multiple Regression analyses were conducted to examine the ability of fish preparation to predict cardiovascular reactivity to stress during each measurement  period and cardiovascular activity collapsed across periods. In addition, Multiple Regression analyses were used to examine the ability of fish preparation to  predict cardiovascular activity separately for men and women. Lastly, a Product- Moment correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between fish  preparation and cardiovascular reactivity to the stressor. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., 2016) computer program was used to  conduct all data analyses [9]. A 95% confidence interval level was used to determine significance of each statistical analysis. Means for all study variables  are in Table 1.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Fish Preparation and Cardiovascular Activity</h3>\r\n<p>It was hypothesized that fish preparation and fish would significantly predict cardiovascular activity. Specifically, healthy fish preparations (grilling and  baking) would be associated with lower cardiovascular activity and unhealthy fish preparations (frying) would be associated with greater cardiovascular activity.  Fish preparation significantly predicted mean arterial blood pressure during the pre-stressor period, Beta = -.275, t(1, 125) = 3.2, p = .002. It also  significantly predicted diastolic blood pressure during the stressor period, Beta = -.265, t(1, 125) = 3.07, p = .003, and recovery period, Beta = -.231,  t(1,122) = 2.62, p = .010. Lastly, fish preparation significantly predicted diastolic blood pressure collapsed across periods, Beta = -.223, t(1,127) = 2.58,  p = .011, and mean arterial pressure collapsed across periods, Beta = -.211, t(1,126) = 2.42, p = .017. These findings indicate that contrary to the hypothesis,  participants who prepared their fish in a healthy manner had higher blood pressures.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Fish reparation and Cardiovascular Activity by Sex</h3>\r\n<p>Separated by sex, fish preparation significantly predicted diastolic blood pressure during the pre-stressor period, Beta = -.206, t(1,96) = 2.07, p =.042,  stressor period, Beta = -.302, t(1,94) = 3.08, p =.003, and recovery period Beta = -.319, t(1,92) = 3.23, p =.002 for women only. In addition, fish preparation  significantly predicted mean arterial pressure during the pre-stressor period, Beta = -.302, t(1, 95) = 3.09, p = .003 for women. Lastly, fish preparation  significantly predicted diastolic blood pressure, Beta = -.286, t(1, 96) = 2.9, p = .004 and mean arterial pressure, Beta = -230, t(1, 95) = 2.30, p = .023,  collapsed across periods for women only. These findings indicate that women who prepared their fish in a healthy manner had higher blood pressures than those  who prepared their fish using an unhealthy technique. Fish preparation did not predict any cardiovascular index for men.</p>\r\n<p>The product-moment correlations revealed that similar to the regression analysis, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were negatively  correlated with unhealthy fish preparation indicating that lowers blood pressures were associated with unhealthy fish preparation (Table 2).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Fish preparation significantly predicted diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. In contrast to the hypothesis, participants, particularly  women, who consume fish using unhealthy preparations (fried fish) had lower blood pressures than those who ate grilled or baked fish. This relationship existed  primarily in the women subsample. The decrease in heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium in fish during frying may account for this finding. Research  studies found that metal in fish has a negative effect on the functioning of the heart by negatively affecting the endocrine system which ultimately results in  increases in blood pressure [10]. Ganbi found that frying fish decreased the amount of lead in fish by 20.7% compared to a decrease of 16.2% from roasting and  13.2% from broiling [11]. Ganbi also found that frying fish decreased cadmium in fish by 100% compared to 20.7% from broiling and 0% from roasting [11]. The  association of unhealthy fish consumption and low blood pressures in the present study may be attributed to the eradication or reduction of the perilous effects  of heavy metals on health from the frying technique. It is apparent that the effects of fish preparation on cardiovascular health are not clear, particularly  for African American women. For example, Belin et al. found that in contrast to White women, baking or broiling fish did not reduce heart failure rates in  African American women [12]. The surprising finding that unhealthy fish preparation was associated with lower levels of cardiovascular activity should be  explored. An examination of the mechanisms underlying this relationship among fish preparation and cardiovascular disease in African American women is warranted.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle\">Limitations of the Study</h3>\r\n<p>A major limitation of the study was the age of the participants (18-28). Since sex differences in cardiovascular functioning may be attributed to estrogen  levels in women, future studies should examine women with various estrogen levels. In addition, since older men are more susceptible to cardiovascular disease  than their younger counterparts, future research should examine the effects of fish consumption and fish preparation on cardiovascular activity in this group.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgments and Compliance with Ethical Standards</h3>\r\n<p>Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: There are no potential conflicts of interests.</p>\r\n<p>Research involving Human Participants: This research project involved human participants and the University Human Institutional Review Board approved the  study protocol.</p>\r\n<p>Informed consent: All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and  national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.

This course may lead to extrinsic obstruction of the ureter. Although commonly referred to as circumcaval or retrocaval ureter, a more  appropriate term may be preureteral vena cava as it is due to a congenital abnormality in development of the vena cava. The prevailing theory of the development  of this anomaly is that the subcardinal vein persists as the infrarenal IVC, thus crossing anterior to the midportion of the ureter and resulting in its  circumcaval course [2]. Others have suggested that the persistence of the posterior cardinal vein as the infrarenal cava is responsible for this anomaly.  However, failure of the supracardinal vein to develop into the infrarenal IVC is common to both theories [3]. The reported incidence of circumcaval ureter  is approximately 1 in 1100. There is a 2.8 fold male predominance [4]. Symptomatic patients typically present in the third or fourth decade of life [5].  This vascular anomaly is not always associated with ureteral obstruction [6]. Abdominal and flank pain, recurrent urinary tract infection, and hypertension  are some of the initial symptoms and signs. A number of cases are now discovered on imaging studies performed to evaluate patients with nonurologic problems [7].  The diagnosis can be confirmed with Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Diuretic renography is used to confirm the presence and  determine the functional impact of obstruction.</p>\r\n<p>The standard repair of retrocaval ureter is ureteroureterostomy. This has been performed by open, laparoscopic, and retroperitoneoscopic approaches and is  best dictated by the surgeon&rsquo;s experience. Retrocaval ureter has been managed successfully with the laparoscopic approach in the clinical setting as shown by  a series of sporadic case reports in recent years [8]. Either a transperitoneal or a retroperitoneal approach may be used laparoscopically. The overall clinical  results of the laparoscopic repair in the literature have been favorable, providing minimal postoperative patient morbidity, short convalescence, and  anastomotic patency on short-term radiographic follow-up. The main limiting factor for both the transabdominal and the retroperitoneal laparoscopic repair of  the retrocaval ureter was the intracorporeal anastomosis of the ureter that significantly increased the surgical time. With increasing experience in  intracorporeal suturing, operative time has been minimized. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in the management  of retrocaval ureter.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Material and Methods</h3>\r\n<p>This was a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with retrocaval ureter from January 2007 to February 2018 at our institute. Total of 21 patients  were diagnosed with this rare anomaly. The decision of open and laparoscopic approach was done on the basis of patient preference. 20 of these patients had  radiological evidence of retrocaval ureter on Intravenous Urography (IVU)/CT urography and obstruction demonstrated on diuretic renography (Figure 1). Out of  20 patients 11 underwent open ureteroureterostomy and 9 were corrected by transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery. All the patients were operating by single  surgeon. 1 patient was asymptomatic and had normal drainage on DTPA renal scintigraphy and is doing well in follow-up without any symptom and hence not operated  and was kept on regular follow-up.</p>\r\n<p>Presentation was flank pain, recurrent urinary tract infection and three were diagnosed incidentally when being evaluated for other complaints. The open  ureteroureterostomy was performed through right subcostal flank approach. After identifying the ureter, it was dissected proximally and distally. The ureter  was divided proximally and transposed anterior to vena cava. The narrow segment was excised and ureteroureterostomy was done after spatulating the two ends over  the 5 F double J stent (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p>The laparoscopic repair was performed through transperitoneal approach. After establishing the pneumoperitoneum with open method three ports were place.  10 mm camera port at the umbilicus, 10 mm port at right midclavicular line below the costal margin and another 5 mm port was placed at middle of right  spinoumblical line. Colon was mobilized medially and ureter identified. Ureter was divided proximally and the transposed anterior to IVC, ureteroureterostomy  was performed after spatulating the ureter over the 5F DJ stent (Figure 3).</p>\r\n<p>The DJ stent was removed after 4 weeks. IVU and DTPA scan was performed after 3 months from surgery to see the outcome. The operative time, blood loss,  analgesic requirement, perioperative complications, hospital stay were compared. Patients were given paracetamol infusion for first 24 hours and then oral  combination of paracetamol and diclofenac. The success was defined as radiologically patent, unobstructed upper ureter with improved or maintained renal  function on DTPA scan. Formal chart review was completed with all perioperative data completed and statistical analysis was done by fischers exact test and  unpairted t-test.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>There was no difference between the two groups regarding patient demographics. The mean age of presentation was 29.6 &plusmn; 7.34 years in open group and 31.22 &plusmn;  8.36years in lap group. The preoperative characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1.</p>\r\n<p>There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding mean estimated blood loss, 57 &plusmn; 27.50 [range: 30&ndash;90] ml in open vs. 35 &plusmn; 11.72 [range: 20&ndash;60] ml in lap, p &gt;0.5. The mean operative time was longer in lap group, 112.77 &plusmn; 25.98, [range: 90&ndash;160 min] vs. 91.5 &plusmn; 26.03 [range: 60&ndash;130] min in  open group, p value &lt; 0.5. Mean hospital stay was longer in open group (5.6 &plusmn; 1.71 [range: 4&ndash;9 days] compared to lap group 3.22 &plusmn; 0.44 [range: 3&ndash;4] days),  p value&lt;0.5. The drain was removed on average postoperative day 2&plusmn;0.33 (range 2-3) in lap group and 4.6&plusmn;1.73 (range 3-6) in open group, p value&lt;0.5. The  analgesic requirement was more in open group (5.1&plusmn; 1.21 days) compared to laparoscopic group (3.11 &plusmn; 0.51days), p value &lt; 0.5. Three patients in open group  had wound infection; two of them required secondary suturing (clavien grade 3a). Four patients in open group and two in lap group had fever in postoperative  period that responded to conservative means (clavien grade 2). One patient in lap group had ureteric stricture detected on follow-up after 6 months of surgery  that was corrected by balloon. None of the patient in laparoscopic group required conversion to open. Comparison of perioperative and postoperative data are  shown in Table 2.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Retrocaval ureter is a rare congenital urologic anomaly. It occurs as a consequence of the persistence of the posterior cardinal veins during embryologic  development [9]. Today, a definitive diagnosis can be made noninvasively utilizing three-dimensional CT. Procedural intervention is indicated in the presence  of functionally significant obstruction leading to pain or renal function deterioration. The first observed case of retrocaval ureter was described by  Hochstetter in 1893 [10]. The anomaly predominantly involves the right ureter and in our study, all retrocaval ureter were on right side. If it involves the  left ureter then it is usually associated with either partial or complete situs inversus or duplication of the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). A total of 20% of cases  of retrocaval ureter present with concomitant anomalies, mainly from cardiovascular system and genitourinary tract. Associated anomalies are right double  inferior cava, ipsilateral ureterocele, glandular hypospadias, supernumerary lumbar vertebrae, Syndactylia, Partialsitusinversus and Vesicoureteric Reflux (VUR)  [11]. In our study, none of the patient had associated anomaly.</p>\r\n<p>Circumcaval ureter has been classified using different parameters based on IVU or retrograde pyelographic findings. Bateson and Atkinson (1969) classified a  ureter with an S-shaped, fish hook, or shepherd&rsquo;s crook appearance as type-I. The ureter typically overlies or is medial to the lower lumbar vertebral processes  and eventually crosses anterior to the iliac vessels, where it then assumes a normal distal course in this setting. A less angulated &ldquo;sickle-shaped&rdquo; ureteral  deformity is classified as type-II. The point of maximal obstruction in type-I is lateral to the lateral margin of the IVC and is associated with a greater  degree of hydronephrosis than type-II, in which the point of obstruction is at the lateral border of the IVC [12].</p>\r\n<p>The classical treatment for retrocaval ureter consists of separating the ureter, re-anastomosing its stumps and replacing the ureter in its usual position  while maintaining its patency. The open ureteroureterostomy remained the gold standard surgical approach to treat the retrocaval ureter for many years. Matsuda  et al first performed the laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy for a retrocaval ureter in 7.5 hours using five laparoscopic ports [13]. The main limiting factor for  both the transabdominal and the retroperitoneal laparoscopic repair of the retrocaval ureter, was the intracorporeal anastomosis of the ureter that significantly  increased the surgical time. Simforoosh et al reported a series of 6 cases of retrocaval ureter that were successfully treated with a transperitoneal  laparoscopic approach. Mean operative duration was 180 minutes (range 150 to 210) and patients were discharged home at a mean of 4 days (range 3 to 5) [14].  Ding et al reported the largest series of transperitoneal approach in 2012. Nine patients underwent pure laparoscopic pyelopyelostomy or ureteroureterostomy.  The mean operative time was 135 minutes (range, 70&ndash;250 minutes). No intraoperative complications or significant bleeding occurred [15]. Operative time in our  study was 112.77 &plusmn; 25.98 minutes, which is less than most of the previous studies. We had used 3-4 ports and transperitoneal approach was used. Large space in  transperitoneal approach makes suturing easy compared to retroperitoneal approach. With increasing experience in intracorporeal suturing, operative time has  been minimized. Our study demonstrates that laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy may be safely and effectively performed in a reasonable operative time, with return  to normal activity within short span of time compared to open approach. Comparisons between historical reports about open surgery and laparoscopic surgery for  retrocaval ureter have clearly shown the advantages of minimally invasive approaches like less intraoperative bleeding, a shorter post-operative hospital stay,  reduced postoperative pain, earlier return to daily activities and a significant superior aesthetic effect, while preserving therapeutic efficacy. In our study  all nine patients operated by laparoscopic approach had an uneventful recovery without any major complication. All patients operated by laparoscopic approach  were asymptomatic in postoperative follow-up with imaging showing correction of obstruction. Only one patient developed stricture at anastomotic site that was  rectified by non-cutting high pressure balloon dilatation insufflated up to 12 am for 7 minutes and the ureter was stented for 6 weeks. Follow-up scan was done  6 weeks after stent removal revealed normal drainage. The possible cause of stricture may be inadequate speculation of ureter.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Certainly our series is large, and knowing the advantages of laparoscopy as a minimally invasive technique with less bleeding, less drug requirement, and  short hospital stay while performing various procedures for different diseases in urology, it should be proposed as a first-line treatment for retrocaval ureter.  The choice of transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach depends on the preferences of the surgeon.</p>\r\n<p><b>Protocol/ Project Development:</b> SA Para</p>\r\n<p><b>Data Collection/ Management:</b> SA Wani and SA Para</p>\r\n<p><b>Data Analysis:</b> SA Malik and SA Wani</p>\r\n<p><b>Manuscript Writing/Editing:</b> SA Wani</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Conflict of Interest</h3>\r\n<p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p>\r\n<p>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p>\r\n<p>No Source of Funding.</p>\r\n<p>This Article does not contain any studies with animals performed by any of the authors.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009926069801662 target=\">Bateson EM,&nbsp;Atkinson D (1969) Circumcaval ureter.

Plant extracts are safer to  use, non toxic to target organism and do not leave residues in the environment. Chemical control was found to be successful. But due to pesticidal pollution  posed by excessive and indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides, plant products have drawn the attention of present research in plant protection.</p>\r\n<p>The efficacy of <em>Pongamia pinnata</em> on biochemical content of polyphagous pest <em>Mylabris indica</em> has been studied. The effect of plant extract  of <em>Pongamia pinnata</em> at the post feeding and post treatment phase and the level of carbohydrate, protein and lipid have been investigated. The level of  carbohydrate decreased to 22, 53 and 61 % respectively. The protein content is also decreased to 26, 48 and 74% respectively. The lipid level was decreased to  28, 36 and 65%.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p><em>Mylabris indica</em>; Carbohydrate; Protein, Lipid, <em>Pongamia pinnata</em></p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Natural pesticides are active principles derived from plants for the management of human and animal pest organisms or it can be said to be biologically  active ingredients, principally derived from plants, for the management of human and animal pest organisms [1]. Botanical pesticides are easily biodegradable  and their use in crop protection is a practically sustainable alternative. It maintains biological diversity of predators and reduces environmental  contamination and human health hazards. The use of plant extracts to control destructive insects pests or disease vectors is not new. Rotenone  (<em>Derris</em> Spp), nicotine and pyrethrins have been used for a considerable time in small-scale subsistence and also in commercial agriculture [2-4].</p>\r\n<p>Insect-pests are known to cause significant damage to crops and affect agricultural productivity. The monetary loss due to feeding by larvae and adult  insects alone contributes to billion dollars per annum [5]. The increasing concern for environmental safety and global demand for pesticide residue free food  has evoked keen interest in pest control through eco-friendly plant products which are easily biodegradable and do not leave any harmful toxic residues besides  conserving natural enemies [6-8].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Material and Methods</h3>\r\n<p><em>M. indica</em> are small, black and easily recognized by the yellow striped on elytra. Mouth parts are of biting and chewing type [9]. Blister beetles  have entirely different feeding habits as adults and larvae. The adults feed on flowers. The larvae are mostly beneficial and do not feed on plant. The larvae  attack the eggs of harmful insects like grass-hopper and locusts [10].</p>\r\n<p><em>M.indica</em> was collected in and around T.Kalluppatti, Madurai district, Tamil Nadu. To avoid genetic variation, beetles were collected from the  same locality for each experimental series. Thus stock animal was allowed to acclimatize to the laboratory temperature 28&plusmn;2&deg;C with relative humidity of 80&plusmn;5%.  During this period, insects were fed with fresh flowers of host plant <em>Hibiscus rosasinesis</em>. The beetles of required body weight, size were chosen for  present investigation.</p>\r\n<p>Adult beetles of similar size were isolated and reared separately in plastic containers and fed daily with <em>Hibiscus rosasinesis</em> flower soaked in  different concentration (2, 6 and 10%) of <em>P. pinnata</em> plant extract. Soaking of flowers in the plant extract is done for period of 10 seconds. Similarly  control was fed daily with fresh flowers. Fresh food was provided daily. The biochemical profiles of protein, carbohydrate and lipid are estimated as methods of  lowry et al., Seifter et al., and Bragdon [11-13].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Result and Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>After sufficient trials on various percentage of extract on different weight groups 3, 5, and 7% were firmly justified for treatment studies. The response  was similar to the earlier studies. The <em>M.indica</em> chosen for the above treatment percentages are respectively on lower, ideal and higher weight group  <em>M.indica</em> (351-550mg, 451-650mg, and 501-700mg). The 2% extract on lower weighed groups hadmortality on 8<sup>th</sup> day . But 6% and 10% extract on ideal and  higher weight groups had mortality on 10<sup>th</sup> day.</p>\r\n<p>The adult beetle <em>M.indica</em> exposed to extract experienced a decline in protein content. The reduction in total protein in the body tissues of  <em>Euproctis fraterna</em> larva treated with carrot seed extract was reported by Chockalingam et al., Jeyapandi and Shunmugavelu, Reddy [14-16] suggested that  decreased protein content in toxicant treated animal may be due to binding of insecticides of cellular components. The reduction of protein may be due to the  formulation of tannin-protein complex. The protein level of <em>M.indica</em> on treatment with <em>A.indica</em> display distinct dose dependent decline.  In <em>P. pinnata</em> the impact was more with 2, 6 and 10% as 26, 48 and 74% (Table 1 and Figure 1). The lipid level was decreased to 28, 36 and 65%.</p>\r\n<p>Carbohydrate content of the plant extract treated beetles was less when compared to control. Such depletion may be due to the utilization of the sugar at  the time of high energy demands warranted by the altered metabolism caused by toxic stress as suggested by Noorjahan, Jeyapandi, Beck [17-19] has reported  that the insufficient amount of carbohydrate result in sub optimal growth. Carrot seed extract treatments Chokkalingam et al., [14] caused considerable  depletion in sugar content of <em>Euproctis fraterna</em>. Nalina Sundari [20] reported that alkaloids of <em>V.rosea, D.metal</em> and <em>E. globules</em>  significantly diminished the carbohydrate content of <em>Euproetis fraterna</em>. Carbohydrate represents the principal and immediate energy for precursors  for animals exposed to stress condition while protein being the energy source to spare during chronic periods of stress. <em>M.indica</em> treated with  <em>P.pinnata</em> responded in 2, 6 and 10% extract and degrease were 22, 53 and 61% respectively. It clearly indicated a dose dependent decline in level of  carbohydrate.</p>\r\n<p>The rise in lipid level of <em>M.indica</em> during toxic stress of plant extracts has also been observed. The rise in lipid level may be an adaption to  overcome the toxic stress created by the plant extract. A reduction in lipid content in <em>M.indica</em> was also observed due to the higher treatment of the  plant extract [21]. Total lipid control was decreased in plant extract treated insects when compared to control [22-23]. The lipid level of <em>M.indica</em>  on treatment with <em>P.pinnata</em> the impact was more with 2, 6 and 10% as 28, 36 and 65%. Nalinasundari [20] has observed due to the similar treatment.  Hence, the present study suggested that <em>P.pinnata</em> plant extract have drastic impediments on growth performance, basic biochemical profiles and  associated parameters.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>Ivbijaro, M.F. 1990.

A vomerine flap, facilitates single layer primary closure of the hard palate, using a mucoperiosteal flap and leaving raw bone behind. This was  first described by Pichler in 1926 [2]. Many surgeons incorporate this vomerine flap at the same time as completing the cleft lip repair, as popularised by  Oslo [3,4]. However, there is little in the literature about the underlying mechanism of the healing of the raw areas and exposed bone.</p>\r\n<p>Animal histological studies suggest two mechanisms of healing. Epithelialisation from the mucosal edge, healing by secondary intention scar contraction or  a mixture of both [5,6]. It has also been shown that complete mucosal wound healing of 6 mm lesions in the oral cavity takes 15 days [1].</p>\r\n<p>Several contributory factors explaining the minimal scarring of oral mucosa have been reported, including unique fibroblast phenotypes, reduced inflammation  and growth factors present in saliva and the moist environment [7,8]. Animal studies have demonstrated that saliva application can even enhance skin wound  healing and reduce inflammation [9-13], a phenomenon which may be attributable to the presence of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) [11] Red Duroc pig models  resemble human wound healing in both skin and oral mucosa [14-17] and have shown that scar formation in oral mucosa is significantly reduced both clinically  and histologically, compared to the scarring in a skin wound [16,17].</p>\r\n<p>Direct visualisation of vomerine healing may enhance our understanding of the mechanism by which the healing occurs. This article documents the healing of  a single layer vomerine flap utilised in an anterior hard palate cleft repair using serial intraoral photographs. These photos provide insight into the distinct  phases of recovery from surgery in the oral cavity.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Material and Methods</h3>\r\n<p>This is an observational, single case study following vomerine flap and lip repair as the first stage of the primary Closure of a complete Unilateral Cleft  Lip and Palate in a six month old child (CUCLP). This technique is known as the Oslo sequence [4]. Images were taken, using a 120 degree Karl Storz endoscope  (The Karl Storz 7230 EA Hopkins II Rod lens Endoscope 18cm x 4mm), of the roof of the mouth, pre- and postoperatively in the anaesthetised child. Subsequently,  photographs were taken daily for 15 days in the outpatient setting. The child had clear liquids for 2 hours prior to the photographs to reduce obscuring the  images. Photographs were then taken weekly for a further 3 weeks. Parental consent was obtained for all images.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>Over 300 images were taken of the healing palate to visualise the healing process. Figure 1 demonstrates the preoperative image of the hard palatal cleft.  Having reviewed all the images, healing appears to occur in 4 phases. Within 24 hours, an exudative fibrin clot is present over the central exposed area  [Figure 2]. This clot remained until day 9. On day 10, pink islands were seen through the slough, and palatal mucosalisation was noted to extend from the free  palatal edge [Figure 3]. On days 10-14, the depth of the base of the flap advanced towards the oral surface with some inflammatory exudate still present  [Figure 4]. On day 18, mucosalisation of the vomer was seen alongside bridging to the palatal side, resembling normal mucosa [Figure 5]. Photos of the healed  repair were taken at day 35 [Figure 6].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Wound healing is a complex pathophysiological process orchestrated by multiple factors, occurring in several phases; haemostasis, inflammation, tissue  formation and remodelling [18-21], which overlap in time. Fibroblasts are pivotal to this process. Fibroblast synthesis is the ground work for regeneration  including collagen and ground substances [17-20]. Following this, myofibroblasts mediate wound contraction through small muscle proteins actin and tenascin C  [21]. There are various differences between mucosal and cutaneous wound healing. Firstly, mucosal wounds demonstrate accelerated healing with minimal scar  formation, with hypertrophic scarring occurring far less frequently than in cutaneous wounds [17]. Another difference between mucosal and cutaneous wound  healing is the reduced inflammation seen in oral wounds. They contain lower concentrations of inflammatory cells and cytokines [11,14,17,19], while undergoing  the same stages of wound healing. It has been demonstrated that healing mucosal wounds contain fewer macrophages, neutrophils and T cells as well as other  inflammatory cytokines when compared to cutaneous wounds [11,20]. Oral wound beds have also been shown to be less vascular than cutaneous wounds, with lower  expression of vascular endothelial growth factor [21]. Dog cheek models demonstrated that despite having a muscle base, epithelialisation follows a similar  pattern to cutaneous healing from wound edges [22,23]. While little remains known of the mechanism of healing post palate repair, our study is the first to  provide a visual record and establish a timeline of the process. The images shown in this study support two mechanisms of vomerine flap mucosalisation.  On day 10, pink islands were seen below the slough, which were thought to be islands of mucosa. These images suggest healing by granulation and  re-epithelialisation. On days 10-14, the depth of the base of the flap advanced towards the oral surface, suggesting an additional element of secondary  intention healing with scar contraction. A randomised controlled trial in CUCLP, comparing soft palate repair first versus hard palate and lip repair first  and their effect on the maxillary arch form, three months post-operatively, showed no change in the intertuberosity distance between either method. The anterior  first technique had a significant narrowing of the anterior alveolar gap and of the intercanine distance, but not with the soft palate first technique,  supporting that contracture may also be involved in the closure mechanism of the raw vomerine flap.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>This paper records photographic images of the healing process of a vomerine flap repair. Epithelial ingrowth beneath a fibrin clot starts shortly after the  initial operation. While epithelialisation occurs from the palatal edges, the wound also heals three dimensionally by filling and contracting from its base.  It is possible that both methods of healing occur in vomerine flap healing in succession, with the images taken supporting theories from previous animal models.  The images also support the idea that vomerine wound healing follows the same pattern as cutaneous wound healing, but at a faster rate.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15348880 target=\">Leenstra TS, Kuijpers-Jagtman AM, Maltha JC (1998) The healing process of palatal tissues after palatal surgery with and without implantation of membranes: an experimental study in dogs.

In most occasions, it is preceded by a definite antecedent history. Acute ureteric obstruction secondary to calculus disease is one of the common conditions that we come across in clinical practice. It may also occur secondary to retro-peritoneal fibrosis, malignancies of intra-abdominal solid organs or after a blunt injury to abdomen [1]. Such urinomas are usually located in the peri-renal region. Rarely, they may be found extending to peritoneal cavity, pleural space or even the mediastinum [2]. Most of the urinomas are unilateral. Bilateral spontaneous urinomas are rare. Such bilateral urinomas are usually secondary to obstructive uropathy, especially posterior urethral valves, pelvi-ureteral junction obstructions or vesico-ureteral reflux [3,4]. Most of the reported cases are usually observed in children [5]. Spontaneous bilateral perinephric urinomas in adults are extremely rare. It is even rarer to come across a condition of bladder outlet obstruction and poor compliance of urinary bladder, especially in young adult females. In our manuscript, we present a young female who presented with spontaneous asymptomatic bilateral subcapsular urinoma due to poorly compliant bladder with high pressure voiding.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Case report</h3>\r\n<p>A 20-years-old unmarried female patient presented with bilateral loin pain and recurrent episodes of high grade fever with chills and rigors for 2 weeks. She had a past history of voiding difficulty with constipation, since childhood. On admission, she was febrile and had bilateral loin tenderness with a palpable tender right loin mass. Laboratory investigations revealed a high total  leucocytic count of 22,000 with raised creatinine of 2.3mg/l. Urine and blood culture grew E. coli. She was managed conservatively with antibiotics and antipyretics. Ultrasound (USG) showed bilateral thick walled subcapsular collection [Figure 1A and 1B]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of whole abdomen showed bilateral urinoma with mass effect on both the kidneys [Figure 1C and 1D].</p>\r\n<p>Patient was planned for cystoscopy, bilateral Retrograde Pyelogram (RGP) and bilateral diagnostic ureteroscopy. Diagnostic ureteroscopy with &lsquo;double J&rsquo; stenting was done. She was managed conservatively with IV antibiotics. Serum creatinine improved to 1.5mg/dl and the patient was discharged after catheter removal on second post-operative day. Within a week, she presented to the emergency with fever and bilateral loin pain. Computed  Tomography (CT) scan revealed an increasing perinephric collection with double J stents in position [Figure 2A and 2B]. Hence, bilateral Percutaneous Drainage (PCD) nephrostomy tube placement was done. About 150ml and 90 ml of clear fluid was aspirated from the right and left side respectively. The aspirated fluid creatinine levels were suggestive of extravasated urine. Patient was also evaluated for bladder dysfunction with uroflow and urodynamic evaluation. Uroflowmetry showed a Qmax 11 ml/ sec with a post void residue of 170ml [Figure 3A]. Urodynamic evaluation revealed high pressure voiding with poorly compliant bladder [Figure 3B]. She was catheterized and started on alpha blockers and anticholinergics following which she improved and her serum creatinine levels normalized. Patient was discharged on seventh post-operative day. Foley catheter and the stents were removed after 4 weeks. She was followed up with urine culture, blood culture, ultrasound and repeat uroflow. Her cultures were sterile and the upper urinary tracts were normal. She voided with a Qmax 30ml/sec and nil post void residual urine. Patient is on regular follow up and remains asymptomatic till date.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Encapsulated collection of urine in the perinephric space is defined as urinoma [6]. Though commonly seen around the perinephric space, urinomas can also be seen in the retro peritoneum, peritoneal cavity, pleural cavity, and even in the mediastinum [7]. Urinoma usually occurs due to obstructive uropathy like calculi, pelvic tumors, congenital obstructive causes, prostatic enlargement and non-obstructive causes [8]. Neurogenic voiding dysfunction as a cause of bilateral spontaneous urinoma is rare. Urinomas have also been reported secondary to NSAID induced acute interstitial nephritis and membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis [9,10]. Urinomas secondary to neuro-vesical dysfunction are rarely reported. Only a few such cases were reported in the literature to our knowledge [11].</p>\r\n<p>Various theories have been proposed for urinoma formation. Obstruction of the urinary tract leads to increased intrapelvic pressure, pyelo-sinus backflow with resultant rupture of the collecting system as a pop off mechanism leading to urinoma formation in the subcapsular or perirenal space [12,13]. Maitra et al reported a case of bilateral spontaneous urinoma in a patient with bladder outlet obstruction [14]. Fujita et al reported a case of Urinoma secondary to neurogenic bladder and Vesicoureteric reflux [15]. Our patient had high pressure voiding with poor bladder compliance resulting in bilateral spontaneous urinoma which is unusual. Contrast enhanced CT usually reveals hydroureteronephrosis and contrast extravasation into the perinephric space. Our patient had an MRI done in view of deranged renal function. It is very imperative for the treating urologist to take a detailed history and perform a thorough clinical examination in such patients. A high index of clinical suspicion is also needed to identify such conditions at an earlier stage itself. Patient with neurogenic bladder dysfunction should be probed for any history of voiding difficulty or bowel disturbances, which might help in making early diagnosis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Bilateral spontaneous urinomas, although rare, should be considered as one of the significant complications in patients with neuro-vesical dysfunction. This case report demonstrates the need for adequate history and appropriate imaging and urodynamic evaluation in patients with neurogenic high pressure voiding dysfunction in order to diagnose such rare conditions at an earlier stage.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Retroperitoneal+Cystic+Masses%3A+CT%2C+Clinical%2C+and+Pathologic+Findings+and+Literature+Review target=\">Yang DM, Jung DH, Kim H, Kang JH, Kim SH, et al.

The two states are affective disorders, and It is hypnotized  that the temperament is the fundamental of this relationship between these states.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Anxiety; Depression; Temperament</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; refer to more general concept. It is the pattern of behavioral, subjective, cognitive and physiological responses to underlying  psychobiological state. &ldquo;Affect&rdquo; usually refer to the minute-to-minute or hour-to-hour situation in the individual emotional state, whereas &ldquo;mood&rdquo; usually  refers to the more enduring aspects of the individual emotional state, particularly the presence of a pervasive emotion, which endures over relatively long  periods, because of hereditable basis and construct. The concept of &ldquo;mood&rdquo; is closely related to the concept of &ldquo;temperament&rdquo; and &ldquo;character&rdquo;. Thus, we talk  about individuals who have depressed mood as a long-standing dysthymic temperament. On the other hand, rapidly fluctuating affect states are often  characteristic of certain personality types, notably histrionic personality disorder and borderline personality disorders [1]. The term &ldquo;affective disorder&rdquo;  popular in clinical and research settings, refer to depression conditions and elated manic states. Affective disorders should include anxiety states as well  as abnormalities of other emotions such as guilt, anger and hostility. Neurotic Affective states&rdquo; has been used to refer to both anxiety and depressive  states [2].</p>\r\n<p>The normal emotion in anxiety is fear, while the normal emotion in depression is sadness. Anxiety disorders include disorders that share features of  excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is  anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these two states overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated with surges of autonomic arousal  necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviors, and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in  preparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors.  Panic attacks feature prominently within the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety disorders  but rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well. Table 1 includes the normal emotion, and psychopathologic symptoms.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Anxiety disorders in DSM-5</h3>\r\n<p>The anxiety disorders embodied in DSM-5 are: Separation Anxiety Disorder, Selective Mutism, Specific Phobia, Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia),  Panic Disorder, Panic Attack Specifier, Agoraphobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, Anxiety Disorder Due to  Another Medical Condition, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder [3].</p>\r\n<p>Depression, otherwise known as major depressive disorder or clinical depression is a common and serious mood disorder. Those who suffer from depression  experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness and lose interest in activities they once enjoyed. Aside from the emotional problems caused by  depression, individuals can also present with a physical symptom such as chronic pain or digestive issues. For diagnosing, depressed symptoms must be present  for at least two weeks [4].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Depressive disorder in DSM-5</h3>\r\n<p>The Depression disorders embodied in DSM-5 include: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder  (Dysthymia), Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition,  Other Specified Depressive Disorder, Unspecified Depressive Disorder, Specifies for Depressive Disorders [3].</p>\r\n<p>The DSM-5 outlines the following criterion to make a diagnosis of depression. The individual must be experiencing five or more symptoms during the same  2-week period and at least one of the symptoms should be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.</p>\r\n<p>2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.</p>\r\n<p>3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.</p>\r\n<p>4. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).</p>\r\n<p>5. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.</p>\r\n<p>6. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day.</p>\r\n<p>7. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.</p>\r\n<p>8. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.</p>\r\n<p>To receive a diagnosis of depression, these symptoms must cause the individual clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,  or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms must also not be a result of substance abuse or another medical condition [3]. The controversy has  changed significantly from 1980 according to the DSM-3.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Temperament is Predisposition for Anxiety and Depression</h3>\r\n<p>The most general definition of temperament is that it consists of biologically rooted individual differences in behavior tendencies that are present  early in life and are relatively stable across various kinds of situation and over the course of time (Bates, 1987). The term is most often applied to  behavioral qualities of emotion, attention and activity. There are big areas of behaviors. Only an exceedingly grandiose temperament theory would try to  encompass them in the whole. The most important aspects allocated to temperament are 1- the positivity vs negativity of emotional response in general,  emotional responses to novel stimuli in general, emotional responses to familiar and unfamiliar people in particular., and emotional expression in response  to internal state such as hunger and boredom; 2- attentional orientation patterns, such as soothability when distressed and distractibility of attention;  and 3- motor activity&rsquo;s vigor and frequency and appropriate self-modulation of activity. The temperament concept as behavior traits ought to have a clear  genetic basis, and there is evidence for an early-appearing genetic component in a number of temperamental variables [5].</p>\r\n<p>Depression has been defined as a state of low mood and aversion to activity, can affect a person&rsquo;s thoughts, behavior, tendencies, feelings, and sense  of well-being. Symptoms of the mood disorder is marked by sadness, inactivity, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase/decrease  in appetite and time spent sleeping. A great deal of people also have feelings of dejection, hopelessness, and sometimes-suicidal tendencies. It can be  either short term or long term depending on the severity of the person condition. A depressed mood is a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as  the loss of a loved one. It is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments. Depressed mood may also be  a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia [3].</p>\r\n<p>Personality and temperament influence each other, and the most important aspect of personality are self-concept, defense mechanisms and goodness of fit.  In Psychopathological practice, depression is the most important complication of anxiety disorders occurring in 28 to 91% of patients. The depressive illness  occurring in chronically anxious patients has been labeled secondary, both because it occurs after the onset of the anxiety disorder and appears to develop  in reaction to serve anxiety. Although the temporal relationship between depression and anxiety has an important bearing in the controversy, most studies have  been limited to anxious patients without perior history of depression [6]. The nature of depression occurring in patients with chronic anxiety should help  determine whether it is primary or secondry. It is clear that patients who experience secondary depression have a more chronic and severe anxiety disorders.  It has been showed that anxiety neurotics with a history of depression had more persistant symtoms and greater social impairment at follow-up. Depression  that is secondary tends to be influenced by the course and treatment of the underlying disorder. Depressive illness that occurs in physically ill persons  often resolves when that illness is successfully treated [7].</p>\r\n<p>It is widely recognized that there is considerable overlap between anxiety and depression. Clinicians and researcher&rsquo;s fifer in their thinking about this  relationship. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the controversy was between unitary and dualistic theories. Controversies of the 196s and 1970s were dominated by  efforts to interest new findings from psychopharmacology and from the application of multivariate statistics made possible by high-speed electronic computer [1].  The widely accepted etiological hypothesis proposes a co-occurrence between depression and anxiety, since these conditions share several symptoms and causal  factors. However, hopelessness appears to play a unique role in this co-occurrence [8].</p>\r\n<p>Akiskal H has proposed that dysregulation of temperament is the fundamental pathology underlying mood disorders, and its presence in individuals reflects an  increased predisposition for developing affective disorders [9]. Moreover, specific affective temperament types (depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable,  and anxious) have a strong relationship with suicidal behavior [10].</p>\r\n<p>It is of special importance to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of depression and anxiety, not only because of the high rates of  prevalence of these disorders all over the world but also because this co-occurrence often increases the likelihood that adolescents will develop feelings  of hopelessness which is known to have links with suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors [11].</p>\r\n<p>Another important construct, demoralization, was described as different from depression. Individuals who are demoralized are conscious of their own failure  and are unable to meet the expectations of others. When their anxiety levels increase, they are likely to develop feelings of hopelessness and a desire to die  [12]. The validity of the distinction between depression and demoralization is further supported by research showing that suicidal ideation is differentially  associated with hopelessness and depression. Studies in adolescents have also shown that depression and hopelessness are independent predictors of suicidal  ideation. The dysregulation of temperament is the fundamental pathology underlying mood disorders, and its presence in individuals reflects an increased  predisposition for developing affective disorders. Moreover, specific affective temperament types (depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable, and anxious)  have a strong relationship with suicidal behavior and a study regarding affective temperaments in suicide attempters indicated that compared to controls suicide  attempters scored significantly higher on four of the five affective temperaments containing a more or less depressive component [13].</p>\r\n<p>In spite of the fact that all the above factors, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and affective temperaments, are related to suicidal behavior, no study  so far investigated the interrelationship between these phenomena in a single framework. Delineating the associations between these phenomena is crucial in  understanding how they mediate and influence one another in the development of suicidal behavior, describing possibilities for intervention on multiple levels.  The aim of our present study was to explore the association of the five affective temperaments in the Akiskal model (Depressive, Hyperthymic, Cyclothymic,  Irritable, and Generalized Anxious) with anxiety, depression, and hopelessness in a sample of adolescents. Our study also extends the model of demoralization  by introducing temperament dysregulation, and we propose a two-factor model that explains the relationships between temperament, anxiety, depression, and  hopelessness [6,9].</p>\r\n<p>In sum, the relationship between anxiety and depression is complex and not fully elucidated. As normal emotion, depression and anxiety appear to have  independent evolutionary and neurological basis, although they frequently occur together, particularly in response to aversive life events. Similarly, in  many medical diseases and psychiatric disorders, anxiety and depression symptoms are common and often complicate the diagnosis and treatment of the primary  medical and psychiatric conditions [14].</p>\r\n<p>The most widely used psychobiological technique has been to study the symptomatic response to lactate infusion, which seems to have some specificity to  panic disorder. Other challenge substances have included carbon dioxide, yohimbine and caffeine; hyperventilation could also be a contributing factor [15].  The lactate infusion studies provide a means of experimentally inducing the panic attack and if fully validated as its specificity, would provide not only an  experimental model for panic disorder, but also would contribute to the validity of separating panic anxiety and form other type of anxiety particularly  generalized anxiety from other form of anxiety [16], particularly generalized anxiety from other affective disorders, notably depression and depressive  disorders. Advances in clinical research methodology become more widespread and further clarification of the relationship between anxiety and depression  on one hand, and its relation with temperament and personality on the other hand.</p>\r\n<p>In sum, there were some limitations to the studies have been used cross-sectional study design, longitudinal and survey studies with good sampling for  increasing the external validity. It is significant to study the relationship of temperament with anxiety and depression according to some variable such as:  gender, developmental stage, and academic qualification.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272735885900108 target=\">Keith SD (1985) Relationship between anxiety and depression Clinical Psychology Review 5: 307-324.</a></li>\r\n    <li>Fox NA, Henderson HA, Perez-Edgar K, White L (2008) The Biology of temperament: An integrative approach.

This  system accomplishes certain physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms that can&rsquo;t be accomplished by a single bacterium. The whole process of QS  depends on the production, release, detection and response level of extracellular signaling molecules. In this review, we focus on introducing QS in  gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria with different signal molecules.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Quorum Sensing; Signaling Molecular; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacteria</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Quorum Sensing (QS) is a phenomenon of intercellular communication discovered mainly in bacteria. One or several small signaling chemical molecules  secreted by bacteria spread from cell to cell, facilitating communication among individual bacteria, thus coordinating group behavior. Bacteria can sense  changes in the cell population density of their own or other bacteria in surrounding environment through signaling molecules. With the increase of bacterial  population density and a critical concentration of signaling molecules in the environment, Bacteria change and coordinate the behavior between cells through  activating the expression of specific genes, for achieving certain physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms that a single bacteria cannot complete.</p>\r\n<p>Gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria have different QS systems. The main differences are the diverse QS signal molecules. General signaling  molecules in gram-negative bacteria include n-Acyl-Homo-Serine Lactones (AHLs), quinolones, Diffusion Signaling Factor (DSF), (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoe-4-ketone  (CAI-1) and soon. Modified oligopeptide (AIP) is the most usual signaling molecule in gram-positive bacteria. Besides, there is another kind of  non-species-specific Auto Inducer 2 (AI-2), used for intraspecific and interspecific communication both in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (Table 1).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">QS in gram-negative bacteria</h3>\r\n<p>There are various kinds of autoinducers in gram-negative bacteria. For example, AHLs, one of the most common type of autoinducer in gram-negative bacteria,  has a core n-acylated high serine lactone ring, containing modified 4-18 carbonyl chains. The length of the acyl chain affects stability, which may have an  impact on signal transmission [1-3]. Hundreds of bacteria now contain the LuxI synthetase that produce AHL. The LuxI synthase produces AHL by catalyzing the  acyl side chain of carrier protein binding to S-Adenosine Methionine (SAM) [4]. Four common features were investigated in this kind of QS systems. First,  the autoinducer was able to spread freely through the bacterial membrane. Second: the autoinducer is bound to specific receptors located in intracellular  membranes or cytoplasm. Third: QS usually alters dozens to hundreds of genes that support various biological processes. Forth: in the process of autoinduction,  QS driven by autoinducer stimulates the synthesis of autoinducer and establishes a feedforward ring for promoting the synchronous gene expression in the  population [5].</p>\r\n<p>DSF and CAI-1 are atypical autoinducers. DSF family contains cis-2-unsaturated fatty acids with different chain lengths and branched chains.  Cis-11-methyl-2-dodecaenoic acid was first found in <em>Xanthomonas campestris</em> [6]. Then, much more different signal molecules were reported in different  bacteria, such as rice bacterial leaf blight pathogen <em>X. oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo)</em> [BDSF (cis-2-dodecylene acid), CDSF twelve carbon  (cis-11-methyl-2,5-diene acid)] [7], <em>Burkholderia</em> bacteria (cis-2-dodecylene acid) [8], <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (cis-2-decanoic acid) [9],  <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> (cis-2-14 carbon olefine acid) and <em>Xanthomonas oryzae</em> (cis-11 methyl dodecarbonate 2,5-dienoic acid). These signal  molecules are associated with bacterial virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance.</p>\r\n<p>RpfF, an enzyme of crotonic acid superfamily, is involved in the synthesis of DSF in all bacteria species [10]. It has the activity of desaturase and  thioesterase and takes use of fatty acyl ACP derived from the biosynthesis of fatty acids as substrates. DSF family signaling factors are produced by  3-hydroxy-aliphatic acyl ACP through continuous coordinated action of desaturase and thioesterase [11].</p>\r\n<p>Besides, 3-hydroxypalmitate-methyl (3-OH PAME) and (R)-methyl-3 hydroxynutmeg ((R)-3-oh) MAME) are synthesized by the PhcB protein in  <em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em>, related to virulence and biofilm formation [12,13]. HSL is synthesized by plant-related bacteria, for example,  Isopentyl-HSL is synthesized by <em>Bradyrhizobium japanicum</em> and <em>Aeromonas</em> spp., while cinnamyl-HSL [14,15], is synthesized by  <em>Bradyrhizobium BTAi</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Here, we will detailed introduce several gram-negative bacteria and outline their QS mechanisms.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\"><em>P. aeruginosa</em></h3>\r\n<p><em>P. aeruginosa</em> is a common gram-negative bacterium that causes human acute and chronic infections. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> has four QS systems:  LuxI, LuxR, LasI/LasR and RhlI/RhlR, all of which contains the signaling factors, AHL (N-acylhomoserine lactone). In addition, 2-hept-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone  (PQS) are found both in the PqsR- controlled quinolone signaling system (PQS system) and IQS system acted under phosphate restriction conditions [16].</p>\r\n<p>In the first circuit, 3-oxododecanoy1-homoserine lactone (3OC12HSL) was synthesized by LasI. At HCD, AI was detected by LasR in cytoplasmic. The complex  of LasR-3OC12HSL activates the transcription of target genes, including encoding elastase, protease, and virulence factors such as exotoxin A. The target  of LasR-3OC12HSL are LasI and RhlI. LasI establishes an autoinducer feedforward loop [17] and RhlI synthesizes the second AI-butylated high seronine lactone  (C4HSL), which combine with RhlR at a high concentration [18]. RhlR-C4-HSL can activate target genes, including encoding elastase, protease, and iron carriers  [19]. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> also take use of the quinolone signaling system to control virulence factor gene expression. PQS are produced by PqsA, PqsB,  PqsC, PqsD and PqsH, and detected by the regulator PqsR.</p>\r\n<p>The expression of PqsH and PqsR was activated by LasR-3OC12HSL, while PqsABCD and PqsR are inhibited by RhlR-C4HSL. PqsR-PQS induces the synthesis of  PQS and activated the expression of rhlI and rhlR (Figure 1). Therefore, PQS system is closely related to LasI/LasR and RhlI/RhlR QS system, which also  affects the generation of virulence factors [20-22].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\"><em>Vibrio Cholerae</em></h3>\r\n<p>Cholera is a diarrheal disease characterized by watery diarrhea, can lead to dehydration or death if not treated properly. <em>V. cholerae</em>, the  pathogenic factor of cholera, is controlled by QS to produce an enterotoxin called cholera toxin [23].</p>\r\n<p>(S)-3-hydroxysterane-4-ketone was found in <em>V. cholerae</em>, as an autoinducer in cholera, called Cholera Autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) [24]. In  <em>V. cholerae</em>, CAI-1 autoinducer synthase (CqsA) acts on SAM and decanoyl-CoA to produce amino-CAI-1, which is then converted to CAI-1 spontaneously  [25,26]. CqsA enzymes were found in all <em>Vibrio</em> genera, and they can produce modified CAI-1 with different acyl chain length [27] (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">QS in gram-positive bacteria</h3>\r\n<p>The QS of gram-positive bacteria is different from that of gram-negative bacteria. The signaling factors are mainly modified oligopeptide (autoinducing  pepide AIP). Oligopeptides can be secreted and accumulated extracellular like AHLs, but with the assistance of ABC transporters or other channel proteins.  QS systems with oligopeptides as signal molecules are usually two-component signal systems. Signal molecules outside the cell are recognized and combined  by the binary signal system located on the bacteria when they have reached the threshold, and finally regulate the transcriptional expression of target  genes through a complex signal transduction process.</p>\r\n<p>Diverse functions of gram-positive bacterial QS systems have been reported, such as virulence factor production in the <em>Bacillus cereus</em>, biofilm  formation in <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, and plasmid transfer in enterococcus faecalis [28]. Here, we take <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and  <em>Bacillus cereus</em> as examples.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\"><em>S. auerus</em></h3>\r\n<p><em>S. aureus</em> is found in normal human skin, which causes minor skin infections if epithelial tissue is damaged. These infections can lead to pneumonia,  bacteremia and sepsis [29,30]. The likelihood of infected disease may depends on the expression of a range of adhesion molecules, toxins and compounds which  affect the immune system. QS regulates the expression of genes encoding these virulence factors.</p>\r\n<p>Precursor Autoinducing Peptide (pro-AIP) is encoded by the agrD gene, which is processed into AIP by cell membrane protein AgrB and secreted to extracellular  cells. AIP was detected by two-component signal transduction pathway. AgrC is a membrane-bound histidine kinase, and AgrA is a reaction regulator.  Phosphorylated AgrA activates P2 and P3 promoters of the agr operon, and regulates RNA II and RNA III RNA, respectively. Virulence factor are produced  post-transcriptional activation of RNA III [31].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\"><em>B. cereus</em></h3>\r\n<p><em>B. cereus</em> is closely related to human health. It usually causes intestinal and parenteral infections, especially food poisoning. The production  and secretion of hemolysin, phospholipase, and toxins cause acute diarrhoeal disease [32].</p>\r\n<p>QS in <em>B. cereus</em> requires the transcription factor PlcR. PapR protein was encode by 70 base pairs downstream of PlcR, which has 48 amino acids  and contains amino terminal signal peptide [33]. After leaving the cell, PapR pro-AIP is processed by extracellular neutral protease B (NprB) to form mature  heptapeptide AIP. Mature AIP is transported back to cells by Opp, binds to the transcription factor PlcR and activates it. The PlcR-AIP complex regulates  the production of virulence factors and activates the expression of PapR [34] (Figure 3).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria share QS system</h3>\r\n<p>The LuxS/AI-2 system is a common signal system in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Its signal molecule is difuryl borate, called Autoinducer  2 (AI-2), which can be recognized by different species of bacteria.</p>\r\n<p>AI-2 is produced by decomposing S-adenosine Homocysteine (SAH) into adenine, homocysteine, and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) through a series of  reactions of homocysteine nucleosidase (Pfs) and s-adenosine homocysteine nucleosidase (LuxS). DPD has high reactivity and can be spontaneously cycled into  various furanones. Specific bacterial species detect different forms of DPD as active AI-2 signal. LuxD is a DPD synthetase that exists in more than 500  bacteria species [35], making AI-2 by far the most common bacterial autoinducer.</p>\r\n<p>So far, it was known that there are two main forms of AI-2 in living organisms. The first active form of AI-2 was found in <em>V. harveyi</em>, was  automatically condensed into diester furanyl borate through 4s-4,5-dihydroxy-2, 3-pentanedione (4S-DPD) and boric acid molecules, causing the bacteria  to spontaneously produce fluorescence. The second active form of AI-2, tetrahydroxy tetrahydrofuran (2R, 4S) without boron, found in <em>Salmonella  typhimurium</em>, is produced by directly condensing and cyclizing of DPD and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>\r\n<p>Current studies have reported that the LuxS/AI-2 system can regulate the luminescence of <em>V. harveyi</em>, the biofilm formation of <em>E. coli</em>,  the toxicity of <em>V. cholera</em> and the pathogenicity of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, etc.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusions and Future Perspectives</h3>\r\n<p>QS is a widely existing regulatory mechanism in bacteria, regulates the formation of buds, fusion and transferation of Ti plasmid , luminescence of bacteria  [36], pigment [37], antibiotics [38], biofilm [39], virulence factor [40], bacterial movement and so on. Some plant diseases are caused by the regulation of  the expression of pathogenic genes and virulence factors by the QS system in plant pathogens. Therefore, it is effective to target the QS signal molecules of  pathogenic bacteria and weaken the pathogenicity of pathogens by interfering and destructing the quorum sensing system of pathogen.

Flour was produced from maize and African yam bean seed in the ratio 70:30, respectively. The maize-African yam bean seed flour (MAF) composite was  blended with wheat flour (WF) at 100: 0, 90: 10, 80: 20, 70: 30 and 60: 40, WF to MAF ratios respectively, and were used to produce crackers samples. The  samples were evaluated for sensory evaluation and sample from 70:30 was the most preferred by the panelists based on the overall acceptability. The 70: 30  composites of WF: MAF was further blended with cassava cortex flour at 5, 10, 15 and 20 % while substituting the levels of wheat flour. All the flour samples  were then used to produce crackers and analyzed for chemical composition, microbial and sensory qualities. Results showed a significant (p &gt; 0.05) decrease in  the protein content (9.33-4.41 %) with an increase in the ash (2.05-2.55 %) and crude fiber (1.55-2.14 %) content of the samples as the inclusion of the level  of cassava cortex increased. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the calcium, vitamin but slight increase in the oxalate, cyanide, alkaloid and  tannin contents of all the blended samples compare to the control sample (sample WC). No visible bacteria and mould growth were observed in the control sample  and the blended samples except for samples CF1 and CF4. The sensory scores showed that sample WC (control sample) had the highest scores among all the samples  in terms of flavor, taste, texture, and color, and was also the most preferred by the panelists based on the overall acceptability.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>African Yam Bean Seeds; Crackers; Cassava Cortex; Flour; Maize; Wheat</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Biscuits are a ready-to eat, cheap and convenient food products that are consumed among all age groups globally [1,2]. The reasons for such wide popularity  are their ready-to-eat nature, affordable cost, good nutritional quality, availability in different flavors and longer shelf-life [3]. The association of wheat  consumption with such health problems as the celiac disease makes it pertinent to utilize composite flour in biscuit manufacture, by partial or whole  substitution [4]. Consumption of biscuit appears in the list of top ten daily consumed foods, and they are easily available and convenient to be enjoyed as  a snack [5].</p>\r\n<p>Attempts were being made in recent days to improve the nutritional qualities and functionality of biscuits, due to competition in the market for more  healthy, natural and functional products [6]. Okaka (1999) described the production of biscuits as a mixture of flour and water but may contain fat, sugar/salt,  and other ingredients to form a dough which is rested for a period and then passed between rollers to make a sheet. The baked snack products include cookies,  crackers, and biscuits. Crackers (also known as savory biscuits) are a versatile thin and crispy food that can appeal to a variety of consumer expectation.  They serve as a quick snack with low contents of moisture, sugar, and fat. Due to growing consumer demands for convenience foods, crackers represent one of  the fast-growing segments of bakery products (6). Long shelf-good eating quality, and attractive appearance of crackers make their large-scale production and  distribution possible [7]. However, wheat is a basic ingredient in crackers and has allow content of essential amino acids like lysine, methionine, and  threonine [8]. Also, in recent years, consumers&rsquo; concern over potential health problems caused by eating bakery products has grown due to gluten, a protein  found in wheat [9]. In many parts of Sub-sahara Africa and most especially Nigeria, advancing prosperity and urbanization coupled with a tremendous increase  in population in recent years have led to an increase in the consumption of wheat-based products especially biscuits [10]. Composite flour has the added  advantages of improving the nutrient value of bakery products especially when cereals are blended with legumes e.g. African yam bean seeds, bambara groundnut,  etc. [11]. Crackers were enriched with African yam bean seeds because it is a high protein which would improve the protein content of the crackers. Maize was  added as composite due to the fiber content of maize, which helps to empty to bowl, also good for diabetic and obsessed patients. Also, cassava cortex was  added, and it has a higher percentage of crude protein, fat, minerals and crude fiber than the edible part of cassava. However, this was done to assess the  quality of crackers made from the flour blends of wheat, Maize-African yam bean seed, and cassava cortex.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Procurement of Raw Materials</h3>\r\n<p>The maize (<em>Zea mays</em>), African yam bean seeds (<em>Sphenostylis stenocarpa</em>), cassava (<em>Manihot esculenta</em>) and other ingredients used  in the formulation of the products were obtained from Ogige market in Nsukka, Enugu State.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Sample preparations</h3>\r\n<p><b>Preparation of maize flour </b></p>\r\n<p>Maize was processed into flour according to the method described by [12]. The maize was cleaned to remove stones, bad grains, dust and other extraneous.  The grains were then degermed and dehulled and the hulls discarded. The grains were milled using a hammer mill (Driver Model: De-Demark Super). The particle  size of the emerging flour was further reduced by re-milling and sieving (500 &mu;m pore size sieve). Degermed flour produced was packaged in air-tight containers  prior to use. The flow diagram to produce the flour is given in Figure 1.</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparation of African Yam Bean Seed Flour </b></p>\r\n<p>African yam bean seeds were processed into flour according to the method of Enwere [12]. All the foreign matters and other impurities like stones, dirt,  chaff, weevilled seeds and weevils were removed from the seeds and they were washed with clean tap water. The cleaned seeds were soaked in 1 % citric acid  for two (2) hours and decorticated. The seeds were sun-dried and milled using a hammer mill (Driver model: De-Demark Super) into flour and sieved (500 &mu;m pore  size sieve). The flow diagram to produce African yam bean seed flour is shown in Figure 2.</p>\r\n<p><b>Production of Cassava Cortex Flour </b></p>\r\n<p>The corky layers of fresh cassava cortex were scraped off with a knife and the cortex was washed thoroughly in clean water until free from sand and  adhering dirt. The cortex was then soaked in water for 4 days (96 hours) with 24 hours change of soak water. After 4 days, the cassava cortex was removed  from the water, dried in an oven (Fulton, Model NYC-101 oven) at 50 oC for 24 hours, milled and sieved (500 &mu;m particle size). The flow diagram of the  production is shown in Figure 3.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Preparation of Composite Flour from Wheat, Maize, African Yam Bean Seed, And Cassava Cortex</h3>\r\n<p>Maize and African yam bean seed flour composite (MAF) were blended in the ratio 70:30. Snack was produced from wheat and graded levels (10, 20, 30, and 40 %)  of the composite flour (MAF) and subjected to sensory evaluation in order to identify the most acceptable ratio. The 70:30 crackers sample was the most  acceptable among the blended samples based on the overall acceptability as shown in Table 7. However, 70:30 composite of wheat: maize African yam bean seed  flour which was selected was further blended with cassava cortex flour. Different levels (5, 10, 15 and 20 %) of cassava cortex flour were used to substitute  wheat flour in the most acceptable ratio as shown in Table 1, to produce crackers.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Production of crackers</h3>\r\n<p>Each Combination of flours (WC, MC, CF1, CF2, CF3, CF4) from wheat, maize-African yam bean seed and cassava cortex as shown in Table 1 was used in the  preparation of crackers.</p>\r\n<p>The crackers were prepared using the recipe described by Pattens [13] with slight modification. Fifty (50) grams of fat was rubbed into two hundred grams  of flour from the flour blends already prepared and 2.5 g salt, 20 g sugar, and 1 g baking powder were added. The mixture was blended with 70 ml water to form  a firm dough. The dough was manually rolled into sheets (paper thinness) and evenly cut into tiny shapes. The dough cut was arranged on fat greased baking trays  and baked in a hot oven 150 &ordm;C for 15 mins and cooled.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Sample Analyses</h3>\r\n<p><b>Proximate Analysis of the Samples </b></p>\r\n<p>The moisture (by hot-air oven method), crude fiber, crude protein (Kjeldahl method), fat (Soxhlet extraction) and ash contents of the samples were  determined according to the method of AOAC (2010), while the carbohydrate content was determined by difference. Sum of all the proximate components was  subtracted from hundred (100). The balance was assumed to be carbohydrat % Carbohydrate = 100 - (% protein, fat, fiber, ash, and moisture).</p>\r\n<p><b>Determination of Vitamin Contents of the Samples </b></p>\r\n<p>The photometric method of AOAC [14] was adopted in the determination of vitamin A and Riboflavin (Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>), the method described by [15]  was used in the determination of vitamin E.</p>\r\n<p><b>Determination of Anti-Nutritional Contents of the Samples </b></p>\r\n<p>Tannin was estimated by the Folin-Denis colorimetric method described by Kirk RS, Sawyer (15). Phytate was determined using the spectrophotometric method  described by Kirk RS, Sawyer (15). Oxalate was determined using the method of Iwuoha and&nbsp;Kalu [16].&nbsp;The method of Fuleki and Francis [17] was used for the  determination of Cyanide. Determination of Alkaloids&nbsp;was done by the alkaline precipitation gravimetric method described by Harbourne [18].</p>\r\n<p><b>Determination of Mineral Contents of the Samples </b></p>\r\n<p><b>Determination of Iron, Calcium, and Phosphorus: </b>The Calcium, Iron and Phosphorus contents of the samples were determined using the method of Atomic  Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAnalyst 200, PerkinElmer)&nbsp;as described by Onwuka [19].</p>\r\n<p><b>Microbial Analysis of the Samples </b></p>\r\n<p>The total viable count, mould count, and coliform count were carried out on the samples using the Pour-plate method as described by Harrigan WF, McCance [20].</p>\r\n<p><b>Sensory Evaluation of the Samples </b></p>\r\n<p>Sensory evaluation of the samples was carried out using a 9-point Hedonic scale as described by Ihekoronye and Ngoddy, [21], with a panel consisting of  30 panelists from the Department of Food Science of Technology, University of Nigeria Nsukka. The nine-point Hedonic scale ranged from extremely like (9)  to extremely dislike (1). Samples were presented in identical containers coded with two letters. Each sample was evaluated for flavor, color, taste, texture  and overall acceptability.</p>\r\n<p><b>Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis </b></p>\r\n<p>The experimental design used in this study was Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The experimental results were analyzed statistically using one-way  analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Statistical Product for Service Solutions (SPSS) version 20.</p>\r\n<p>The means were separated using Duncan&rsquo;s new multiple  range test. Statistical significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05 [22].</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results and Discussion</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Proximate Composition of Crackers Made from Wheat, Maize-African Yam Bean Seeds, And Cassava Cortex Flours</h3>\r\n<p>The result of the proximate composition of the crackers samples is shown in Table 2. There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in the protein content  of the samples. The protein content ranged from 4.41 to 9.33 %. The highest value&nbsp;(9.33 %) was observed in sample MC made with 70 % wheat flour and 30%  maize-African yam bean seed flour and the lowest protein content (4.41 %) was observed in sample WC (control sample- 100 % wheat flour). This was followed  by sample CF4 made with 50 % wheat flour, 30 % maize-African yam bean seed flour and the highest (20 %) cassava cortex incorporation. This shows that the  protein content of the samples reduced with increase in the inclusion of cassava cortex flour. Although the protein content was slightly reduced, it was  observed that the protein content of the control sample was still lower than that of the blended sample. According to Ubbor and Akobundu [23], the protein  content of a cassava-based composite flour can be elevated through the incorporation of legume flours since they are usually carbohydrate dense and very  low in protein. The results obtained for protein content (4.41 to 9.33 %) compared well with the results (3.29 to 15.69 %) reported by Owusu et al. [24]  for crackers made from cassava and sweet potato flours.</p>\r\n<p>The values for the ash content of the samples ranged from 2.05 to 2.55 %. The highest value was observed in sample CF4 containing 50 % wheat flour,  30% maize-African yam bean seed flour and 20% cassava cortex flour and sample WC had the lowest value. A significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference was observed  in the ash content of sample WC when compared to other blended samples. An increase in the ash content of the blended samples was observed, this may be  attributed to the incorporation of maize &ndash; African yam bean seed flour blends and cassava cortex flour into the product. Thus, increase in the inclusion  of maize &ndash; African yam bean seed flour blends and cassava cortex flour into the blended samples caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the ash content  of the samples. The ash content observed in this study compared favorably with the values (0.55 to 2.80 %) reported by Owusu et al. [24] for crackers made  from cassava and sweet potatoes flours. Ash content is the total mineral content of products [25].</p>\r\n<p>The crude fiber values obtained ranged from 1.55 to 2.14 %. The crude fiber in the crackers makes them suitable for prevention of constipation. Significant  (p &lt; 0.05) differences were observed in the crude fiber of the samples except for samples MC and CF1. The highest value (2.14 %) was observed in sample CF4  which is the sample blended with up to 20 % of cortex flour. Increase in the inclusion of the levels of cortex flour into the blended samples caused a  simultaneous increase in the crude fiber content of the blended samples. The crude fiber result obtained was lower than the values (14.1 to 17.1 %) reported  by Osundahunsi et al. [26] for cassava fiber as an ingredient in cracker-like products but compared well with the results (2.18 to 2.41 %) reported by Okpala  and Okoli [27] for cookies produced from pigeon pea, cocoyam, and sorghum flour blends. Foods with more fiber are important as they help in emptying the bowel  by expanding the inside walls of the colon, make an effective anti-constipation, lower cholesterol level in the blood and reduce the risk of various cancers  [28].</p>\r\n<p>The moisture content of the samples ranged from 4.85 to 7.45 %. There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences among the samples. An increase in the  moisture content of the blended samples was observed as the maize-African yam bean seed and cortex flours were added. The moisture content of the control  sample (sample WC) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than the blended samples as shown in Table 16, but blended samples had reasonable moisture contents  also that may not affect their keeping quality. At lower moisture content, the deterioration of baked products would be lowered as a result of reduced  activity of microorganisms. According to Ezema [29], microbial proliferation was minimum at low moisture content and it confers higher shelf stability  of the samples. These values observed compare favorably with the values (6.44 to 7.46 %) reported by Okpala and Okoli [27] and are slightly lower than  the values (7.18 to 8.39 %) reported by Agu et al. [30]. Biscuits are generally low moisture foods and this low moisture helps improve the shelf-life of  the products.</p>\r\n<p>The fat content of the samples ranged from 17.94 &ndash; 19.70 %. There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences amongst the samples except for samples WC  (control sample) made with 100 % wheat and CF2 made with 60 % wheat flour, 30 % maize-African yam bean seed flour and 10 % cassava cortex flour. The  high-fat content observed in the samples can be attributed to some of the raw material used for the product formulation especially fat (shortening) or  vegetable oil (which some incorporate during the production of biscuits). The values reported by Owusu et al. [24] for crackers made from cassava and  sweet potatoes flours ranged from 10.31 &ndash;16.47 % and differed from that obtained in this study. This may be due to the differences in the quantity and  the type of fat added or the recipe used.</p>\r\n<p>The carbohydrate content of the samples ranged from 63.30 to 68.46 %. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the carbohydrate content of  sample WC (control sample) compared to other blended samples. A gradual decrease in the carbohydrate content of the blended samples was observed as the  maize-African yam bean seed and cassava cortex flours were added. This agrees with the findings of Yusufu et al. [31] who reported a decrease in carbohydrate  content of cookies when green bean flour was blended with wheat to produce cookies. These values compare favorably with the values (65.08 to 81.28 %)  reported by Owusu et al. [24].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Mineral Contents of the Crackers Samples from Wheat Flour and Maize&ndash;African Yam Bean Seed Flour Blends and Cassava Cortex Flour</h3>\r\n<p>Results of the mineral contents of the samples are shown in Table 3. The iron content of the samples ranged from 0.11 to 0.46 %. There was a significant  (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the iron content of sample WC (control sample) compared to other blended samples except for sample CF2 made from 60 % wheat flour,  30 % maize-African yam bean seed flour and 10 % cassava cortex flour. Iron is an essential trace element in human nutrition and its deficiency is a major  public health threat worldwide. Iron is an important element in the diet to prevent anemia and other related diseases [32].</p>\r\n<p>The phosphorus content of the samples ranged from 58.89 to 136.80 mg/100g. The highest value of phosphorus was observed in sample CF2 (136 mg/100g) and  the lowest value in samples CF3 (58.89 %). There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the phosphorus content of the control sample (sample WC) compared  to the blended samples.</p>\r\n<p>The calcium content of the samples ranged from 0.02 to 0.10 %. There was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference in the calcium content of sample WC  (control sample) compared to all other blended samples. Though a slight decrease in the phosphorus content of the blended samples was observed, this may be  attributed to the inclusion of the maize-African yam bean seed and cortex flour blends into the samples.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Vitamin content of crackers samples from wheat, maize &ndash; African yam bean seed and cassava cortex flour blends</h3>\r\n<p>The result of the vitamin contents of the samples is shown in Table 4. The values of vitamin E in the samples ranged from 1.40 to 2.20 %. There was no  significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference in the vitamin E content of sample WC (control sample) compared to samples MC, CF1 and CF2, except for samples CF3 and CF4  where significant (p &gt; 0.05) differences were observed. The highest value of vitamin E (2.20 %) was observed in CV (made with 50 % wheat flour, 30 %  maize-African yam bean flour and 20 % cassava cortex flour) and the lowest value was in sample WC (control sample). Increase in the level of inclusion of  the flour blends, however, caused a slight increase in the vitamin E content of the blended samples.</p>\r\n<p>The vitamin A content of the samples ranged from 129.03 to 580.65 IU. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the vitamin A content of the blended  samples when compared with the control sample (sample WC). Thus, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the vitamin A content of sample WC compared  to the blended samples. Vitamin A increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with an increase in the level of a maize-African yam bean seed and cassava cortex flours  added. Increase in the vitamin A content of the product may also be attributed to the inclusion of baking fat which is mandatorily fortified with vitamin A  in the dough used in the production of the samples. Vitamin A is critical for vision as an essential component of rhodopsin, a protein that absorbs light in  the retinal receptors, it also supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs,  kidneys, and other organs (Ross, 2010).</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> content of the samples ranged from 0.01 to 0.03 mg and there was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference among the samples although  the increase in the level of addition of the flour blends caused a slight increase in the vitamin B<sub>2</sub> content of the blended cracker samples.  The values (0.01 to 0.04 mg/100g) obtained for vitamin B<sub>2</sub> are lower than the US RDA for children (0.4 to 0.8 mg/100mg) and for adults (1.1 to 1.7 mg/100g).</p>\r\n<p>From the results of the vitamin contents of the samples presented in Table 4, It is evident however that crackers samples prepared from the flour blends  of wheat, maize-African yam bean seed, and cassava cortex were higher in vitamins (vitamins A, B<sub>2</sub>, and E) than the control sample (sample WC).  This may be attributed to the relatively high vitamins in the flour blends added.</p>\r\n<p>More so, it is a known fact that vitamins are heat labile, thus some reduction or changes in the vitamin contents of the samples is expected to occur and  this could be attributed to the heat treatment given to the product during baking.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Residual Anti-Nutrient Contents of Crackers Samples from Wheat, Maize&ndash;African Yam Bean Seed and Cassava Cortex Flour Blends</h3>\r\n<p>The result of the residual anti nutrient contents of the formulated samples is shown in Table 5.&nbsp;The phytate content of the samples ranged from 2.25 to  2.75 %. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the phytate content of sample WC (control sample) compared to other blended samples but there was  no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference between samples WC and MC (made from 70% wheat flour and 30% maize &ndash; African Yam bean seed flour). According to Oke [33],  a phytate diet of 1-6 % over a long period decreases the bioavailability of mineral elements in monogastric animals. The phytate values observed in this study  fall within the safe level of phytate for humans. Phytate binds to such minerals as calcium, zinc, manganese, and iron to form complexes that are indigestible,  thereby decreasing the bioavailability of these elements for absorption [34].</p>\r\n<p>The oxalate content of the samples ranged from 0.25 to 0.84 %. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the oxalate content of sample WC (control  sample) compared to other blended samples but there was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference between samples WC and MC (made from 70 % wheat flour and 30 %  maize &ndash; African yam bean seed flour). The highest value (0.84 %) of oxalate was observed in samples CF3 and CF4 which are samples with a high level of cassava  cortex flour that is 15 and 20 % respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The samples also showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in their cyanide contents but there was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference between samples WC  (control sample) and MC. Sample CF4 (made from 50 % wheat flour, 30 % maize &ndash; African yam bean seed flour and 20 % cassava cortex flour) had the highest cyanide  content of 0.53 % and sample WC (made from 100 % wheat flour) had the lowest cyanide content value of 0.20 %. This low value of cyanide observed in sample WC  can be attributed to the low cyanide content in wheat flour and the high cyanide content observed in sample CF4 may be attributed to the high level of cassava  cortex flour incorporation in the sample. This cyanide level compares well with the recommended cyanide levels by FAO/WHO [35] which is 10 %, to prevent acute  toxicity in humans. It is a known fact that heat reduces the anti-nutrient contents of food and food products when the heat is applied. However, the  anti-nutrient content in the baked products in this study can be compared to the work of Okpala LC, Okoli [27], who reported low levels of hydrogen cyanide  (1.6 to 2.4 %), for cookies produced from pigeon pea, cocoyam, and sorghum flour blends.</p>\r\n<p>The alkaloid content observed in the samples ranged from 0.36 to 0.97 %. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in the alkaloid content of sample  WC (control sample) when compared with other blended samples. The control sample (WC) had the lowest value (0.36 %) of alkaloid compared to other blended  samples. However, this value is within the permissible or safe level of alkaloids for humans which is 0.2 to 0.97 % [36].</p>\r\n<p>The tannin content in the samples ranged from 0.21 to 0.27 %. There was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference in the tannin content of the sample WC  (control sample) when compared with other blended samples. Tannin content observed is within the acceptable/ permissible range. According to Ifie and  Emeruwa (34) reported that high levels of tannins (7.6 to 9.0 %) could be detrimental if consumed. This is because of its ability to bind with proteins  of saliva and mucosal membranes. The increase in the anti-nutrient content of the blended samples when compared with the control sample could be attributed  to the African yam bean seed and cassava cortex flours added to the samples.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Microbial Count of Crackers Samples from Wheat Flour, Cassava Cortex Flour and Maize &ndash; African Yam Bean Seed Blends</h3>\r\n<p>The result of the microbial count of the samples is shown in Table 6. The samples had low bacteria and mould count. The mould count as shown in the Table  below is 0.3 x 10 cfu/g. There was no visible mould growth found in all the samples except for sample CF4.</p>\r\n<p>The bacteria count in the samples ranged from 0.12 x10 to 0.8 x 10<sup>2</sup> cfu/g.&nbsp;The highest bacteria count (0.8 x 10<sup>2</sup> cfu/g) was observed  in sample CF4 containing 50 % wheat flour, 30 % maize - African yam bean flour and 20 % cassava cortex flour. There was no visible bacteria growth found in  all the samples except for samples CF4 and CF1 as shown in Table 6. The bacteria count (0.75 x 10<sup>2</sup> &ndash; 1.2 x 10<sup>2</sup> cfu/g) reported by Nagi&nbsp; et al. [37] for biscuit made from cereal bran compared favorably with the result observed in this study.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of Coliform, it was observed that there was no growth detected in all the samples analyzed. In all the microbial parameters determined, the control  sample (sample WC) had no visible mould, bacteria, and coliform counts. This study has demonstrated that crackers produced from wheat, maize-African yam bean  seed, and cassava cortex flour blends are microbially safe for consumption [38].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Sensory Scores of Crackers Samples from Wheat Flour and Maize &ndash; African Yam Bean Seed Flour Blends</h3>\r\n<p>Table 7 shows the mean sensory scores of crackers made from composite of maize &ndash; African yam bean seed flour and wheat flour (i.e. the preliminary study  done from where the 70:30 ratios of wheat flour: maize-African yam bean seed flour was obtained before it was further combined/blended with cassava cortex  flour as shown in Table 1). Except for the sample color, most other sensory attributes had acceptable ratings. The mean scores for flavor ranged from 5.85  to 8.20, taste ranged from 5.64 to 8.25, texture ranged from 6.15 to 7.95 and overall acceptability ranged from 5.57 to 8.25. The control sample (sample A)  made from 100 % wheat flour had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher scores in all the attributes than the blended samples. It was observed that the level/degree  of preference for all the attributes decreased with increase in the level of substitution of maize&ndash;African yam bean seed flour in the blended samples. There  was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference between sample A and other blended samples in terms of color, flavor, taste, texture and overall acceptability except  for sample B which had no significant (p &gt; 0.05) in the texture when compared with sample A. However, sample B (70 % wheat flour and 30 % maize-African yam  bean seed flour) was the most preferred among the blended samples. Expectedly, an increase in the level of inclusion of maize-African yam bean seed flour in  the blended samples caused a significant decrease in the sensory scores of the samples as assessed by the panelists.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Effect of Incorporation of Cassava Cortex Flour On the Organoleptic Properties of Crackers Produced from Wheat and Maize &ndash;  African Yam Bean Seed Composite Flour</h3>\r\n<p>Results of the mean sensory scores of the samples from cassava cortex flour, wheat flour, and maize &ndash; African yam bean seed flour blends are shown in  Table 8. The control sample (WC) had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher scores than other blended samples in all the attributes (flavor, taste, texture, and  color) evaluated. It was observed that there was a decrease in the mean scores of the attributes (color, flavor, taste, and texture) of the blended samples  as the levels of the incorporation of a maize-African yam bean seed and cassava cortex flours increased. Hence, the decrease in the sensory/organoleptic  properties of the blended samples which evidently affected the choices of the panelists as well as their judgment during sensory evaluation. And this  resulted in low scores which the panelists meted for those blended samples whose sensory properties were impaired as the inclusion of the composite flours  increased. A progressive decrease was observed in the mean scores for color, from 7.13 to 5.23, flavor (7.33 to 5.27), taste (7.70 to 4.85) and texture  (7.45 to 5.40). There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in the flavor, taste and overall acceptability of all the samples. But in terms of color,  there was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference in sample WC (control sample) compared to other blended samples except for samples MC and CF1. Also, there  was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference in the texture of sample WC (control sample) compared to other blended samples except for samples MC and CF2 as  shown in Table 8. The scores of the overall acceptability decreased from 7.50 observed in sample WC made from 100 % wheat flour (control sample) to 4.97  in sample CF4 which had the highest level (20 %) of cassava cortex flour. However, in terms of the overall acceptability, sample WC had the highest value  (7.50) among all the samples and was the most preferred by the panelists.</p>\r\n<p>Broyant et al. [39] reported that the initial acceptance of baked products is much influenced by color which can also be an indicator of baking completion.  The high mean scores observed for color and other organoleptic attributes seem to indicate that all the biscuits were acceptable to the panelists except for  sample CF4 (50 % wheat flour, 30 % maize-African yam bean seed flour and 20 % cassava cortex flour) which was the least preferred by the panelists shown by  its low mean scores for color, flavor, taste, texture and overall acceptability. The observed low scores for sample CF4 in all attributes was attributed to  the high level (20 %) of cassava cortex flour added.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Crackers were formulated from wheat, maize, African yam bean seed, and cassava cortex flours. Analysis carried out showed that the formulated crackers  had a slight reduction in protein with an increase in the ash, crude fiber, calcium and vitamin contents of the blended samples. The formulation of the  crackers by incorporating cassava cortex flour has, however, provided another utilization of cassava cortex as a means of waste management. The crackers  produced had a low microbial load and thus could be stored for a longer time. Though the progressive blending of the samples with maize African yam bean  seed and cassava cortex flours significantly increased the nutrient contents of the blended/fortified samples, the sensory properties were impaired as the  addition of the flours increased. Thus, the acceptability of the blended/fortified samples decreased with an increase in the level of addition of the flours.  However, sample CC (that the control sample made from 100% wheat flour) had the lowest nutrient content but was the most acceptable and preferred by the  panelists.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>Further studies should be carried out on the storage stability of the samples produced from the blends of wheat, maize - African yam bean seed and  cassava cortex flours.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Ethical Review</h3>\r\n<p>This study does not involve any human or animal testing.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target= target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.sciepub.com/reference/54743 target=\">Feyemi PO&nbsp;(1999) Nigerian Vegetables.

Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal  cord to sensitive muscles and cells that recognize emotions such as touch, pain, heat and sound. Damage to peripheral nerves can lead to loss of sensation  and atrophy of leg, thigh and hands muscles [1].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Clinical signs and symptoms of Charcot- Marie-Tooth Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur at any time from early childhood to late adulthood.  The severity of symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tuth disease varies even among members of a family. Some people never realize they have the disorder, but often  have moderate physical disabilities. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems that in rare cases can be life threatening.  But in most cases, Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome does not affect patients&rsquo; life expectancy [1].</p>\r\n<p>Typically, the first symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome include problems with balance and weakness in the leg muscles. As the disease progresses,  the leg and thigh muscles usually weaken, but foot and thigh problems rarely lead to wheelchairs. Injured people may also have weakness in the hands, causing  problems in daily activities such as writing, closing the shirt buttons, and turning the knobs. People with this disorder usually experience tenderness, heat,  and cold in the legs and thighs, but sometimes they feel warm or burning. In some cases, people with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome experience progressive  hearing loss, hearing loss, or vision loss [1].</p>\r\n<p>There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1) syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, a type  of fat white matter that covers and protects nerve cells (neurons). CMT1 syndrome is caused by abnormalities in the myelin sheath of some nerves. This type  of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is characterized by myelin sheath damage in the peripheral nerves. Muscle weakness and atrophy, loss of sensation and slowed  nerve conduction velocities of up to 2 m / s are symptoms of CMT1 syndrome (normally greater than 1 to 2 m/s) [1,2].</p>\r\n<p>The progression of the disease is gradual and symptoms appear between the ages of 2 and 4 years. Less than 2% of patients become wheelchair dependent.  The disease usually does not shorten the life span. There are 4 types of CMT1 that are similar in clinical presentation and are only separated by molecular  genetic testing [1,2].</p>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2) syndrome: is caused by abnormalities in peripheral nerve cell axons. In this type of CMT, peripheral nerve axonal cells  are affected. It is clinically similar to type 1 but less likely to decrease neuronal conduction. CMT2 has fifteen subgroups whose clinical signs are similar  and are subtracted by molecular genetic testing [1,2].</p>\r\n<p>Although the gene involved in most of these subgroups has been identified, in some cases only the chromosome carrying this gene has been identified and  therefore its molecular testing is not yet available <em>in vitro</em> [1,2].</p>\r\n<p><b>Note:</b> Charcot-Marie-Tooth Intermediate type: In this type of CMT syndrome, phenotypic manifestations of myelin axons and cells are observed [1,2].</p>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome Type 3 (CMT3) is a severe neuropathy that begins in the neonatal period. Infants with CMT3 syndrome develop muscle atrophy,  weakness, and sensory problems [1,2].</p>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome Type 4 (CMT4): Symptoms of leg cramps in childhood and adolescence. It is very difficult for these patients to walk.</p>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 5 (CMT5 or CMTX): This syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. This gene mutation affects Schwann cell  communication with axons [1,2].</p>\r\n<p>Other variants of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome are classified as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1 [1,2].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Etiology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is caused by mutations in different genes. These genes provide instructions for the synthesis of proteins that are involved  in the function of peripheral nerves in the legs, thighs and hands. Gene mutations that cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome affect the function of these  proteins, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood. However, these mutations are likely to damage axons that disrupt the transmission of nerve  waves or impair the production of myelin cells. As a result, peripheral nerve cells slowly lose the ability to stimulate muscles and transmit sensory signals  to the brain [1,3].</p>\r\n<p>CMT1 syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes NEP, PMP22, MPZ, LITAF, EGR2. It is worth noting that the PMP22 gene also causes CMT1A and CMT1E syndromes.  The MPZ gene also causes CMT1B syndrome. The LITAF gene also causes CMT1C syndrome. The EGR2 gene also causes CMT1D syndrome. The NEFL gene also causes CMT1F  syndrome. The PMP22 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 as 17p12. The MPZ gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 as 1q23.3. The LITAF  gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 at 16p13.13. The EGR2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 as 10q21.3. The NEFL gene is located  on the short arm of chromosome 8 at 8p21.2 [1,3].</p>\r\n<p>CMT2 syndrome can be caused by the mutation of the MFN2 gene and the KIF1B gene located on the short arm of chromosome No. 1p36.22, the RAB7A gene located  on the long arm of chromosome No. 3q21.3, the LMNA gene on the long arm of chromosome No. 1 is located at 1q22, the TRPV4 gene is located on the long arm of  chromosome 12 at 12q24.11, the BSCL2 gene is located at the long arm of chromosome No. 11 at 11q12.3, the GARS gene at the short arm of chromosome No. 7 is  7p14. 3 is located, the NEFL gene is located on the short arm of chromosome number 8p21.2, the HSPB1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome number  7q11.23, the MPZ gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 Saw 1 is located at 1q23.3, the GDAP1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 at  8q21.11 and the HSPB8 gene is located at the long arm of chromosome 12 at 12q24.23. In addition, some mutations in the DNM2 gene, located on the short arm  of chromosome 19 as 19p13.2, also cause a form of CMT2 syndrome [1,4].</p>\r\n<p>MFN2 and KIF1B genes also cause CMT2A syndrome. The RAB7A gene also causes CMT2B syndrome. The LMNA gene also causes CMT2B1 syndrome. The TRPV4 gene also  causes CMT2C syndrome. BSCL2 and GARS genes also cause CMT2D syndrome. The NEFL gene also causes CMT2E syndrome. The HSPB1 gene also causes CMT2F syndrome.  The MPZ gene also causes CMT2I and CMT2J syndromes. The GDAP1 gene also causes CMT2K syndrome. The HSPB8 gene also causes CMT2L syndrome [1,4].</p>\r\n<p>CMT3 syndrome is caused by mutations of MPZ, PMP22, PRX, EGR2 genes. The PRX gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19 as 19q13.2.</p>\r\n<p>CMT4 syndrome is caused by mutation of MTMR2 gene located on long arm of chromosome number 11q21, SBF2 gene located on short arm of chromosome number  11p15.4, SH3TC2 gene located on long arm of chromosome number 5q32 gene. NDRG1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 8 at 8q24.22, FGD4 is located at  the short arm of chromosome 12 at 12p11.21, the FIG4 gene is located at long arm of chromosome 6 at 6q21 and the genes GDAP1, EGR2 , PRX is created. The  GDAP1 gene also causes CMT4A syndrome. The MTMR2 gene also causes CMT4B1 syndrome. The SBF2 gene also causes CMT4B2 syndrome. The SH3TC2 gene also causes  CMT4C syndrome. The NDRG1 gene also causes CMT4D syndrome. The EGR2 gene also causes CMT4E syndrome. The PRX gene also causes CMT4F syndrome. The FGD4 gene  also causes CMT4H syndrome. The FIG4 gene also causes CMT4J syndrome [1,5].</p>\r\n<p>Medium Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is caused by a YARS gene mutation located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at 1p35.1 and the genes DNM2, MPZ, and GDAP1.</p>\r\n<p>CMT5 syndrome (CMTX) is caused by the mutation of the GJB1 gene located on the long arm of the X chromosome Xq13.1, and the PRPS1 gene located on the long  arm of the X chromosome Xq22.3. The GJB1 gene also causes CMTX1 syndrome and the PRPS1 gene also causes CMTX5 syndrome [1,5].</p>\r\n<p>CMT1 syndrome and most cases of CMT2 and most intermediate forms of the syndrome follow the dominant autosomal inherited pattern. Therefore, a copy of the  mutated genes mentioned in the text (whether father or mother) is needed to create these forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and the chance of having a child  with these forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome In the autosomal dominant state, there is a 50% chance of any pregnancy [1,5].</p>\r\n<p>CMT3 syndrome can follow an autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance pattern. Therefore, autosomal dominant syndrome requires a copy of the MPZ, PMP22,  PRX, and EGR2 genes (including parents) and the chance of having a child with this CMT3 syndrome in autosomal dominant state for any possible pregnancy. 50%.  It is also required to produce CMT3 syndrome in autosomal recessive state, two copies of the aforementioned genes (one father and one mother), and the chance  of having a child with autosomal recessive syndrome is 25% for each possible pregnancy [1,6].</p>\r\n<p>CMT4 syndrome and several subsets of CMT2 syndrome and some forms of intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome follow an autosomal recessive inheritance  pattern. Therefore, two copies of the relevant genes mentioned in the book (one father and one mother) are required for the development of these syndromes  and the chance of having a child with these syndromes in autosomal recessive state for any possible pregnancy It is 25% [1,7].</p>\r\n<p>CMT5 syndrome, or CMTX, follows the dominant X-linked inheritance pattern. Therefore, a copy of the GJB1 and PRPS1 mutant genes (whether father or mother)  is required to develop the syndrome, and the chance of having a child with this syndrome in the predominant X-linked state is 50% for each possible pregnancy.  Be it. It should be noted that despite having two sex X chromosomes mutations in a single set of these genes cause the syndrome, and men with CMTX syndrome  experience more severe symptoms than women. The inherited characteristic of X is that fathers cannot transfer X-related traits to their son&rsquo;s offspring [1,8].</p>\r\n<p>It is worth noting that some cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome are caused by new mutations without a family history [1,9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Frequency of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is the most common hereditary genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. The prevalence of the syndrome worldwide  is about 1 in 2,500 people. It is estimated that Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome has so far affected approximately 150,000 people in the United States [1,10].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of clinical and physical findings of patients and some pathological and neurological tests. The most  accurate method for detecting this syndrome is molecular genetic testing of all the genes listed in the text to determine the presence of possible mutations  [1,11].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The therapeutic pathways of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>The strategy of treatment and management of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Treatment may be coordinated with a team of  specialists including an orthopedist, a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an ophthalmologist, an ear specialist, and other health care professionals. There  is no cure for this syndrome and all clinical measures are to alleviate the suffering of the patients. Genetic counseling is also needed for all parents  who want a healthy child [1,12].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion and Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Hereditary Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy (CMT) known as Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN), Hereditary Sensory Neuropathic Hereditary  Neuropathy (HSMN) as well as peroneal muscular atrophy That affects the peripheral nerves. The name of Charcot- Marie-Tooth comes from the names of three  neurologists who first described the disease in the 19th century. The disease affects the sensory and motor nervous system, which is caused by the gradual  disruption of the structure and function of the peripheral nerves (neuropathy). This disorder occurs symmetrically in the organs, especially the legs and  in the advanced stages of the hands. Charcot-Marie-Tooth with the prevalence of about 1 in every 33,000 people is the most common hereditary neuropathy.  Symptoms of illness usually manifest in the first to third decade of life as muscle weakness and atrophy. Some sources have described the disease as painless.  But this neuropathy can also be associated with pain. Arched feet and hammer-toes are signs of the disease. Mutations in genes involved in the development of  peripheral nerves cause the disease. The inherited pattern of these genes is different. Accordingly, the disease is classified (Table 1) [1-12].</p>\r\n<p>Classifying these genes is not so easy because there have been cases where different mutations in one gene cause a different inherited pattern of disease.  Each of the diseases listed in Table 1 is divided into several diseases based on the damaged gene and the protein product produced [1-12].</p>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth type I (CMT1): This type of Marie-tooth disease is characterized by myelin sheath damage in the peripheral nerves. Muscle weakness and  atrophy, loss of sensation and slowed nerve conduction speeds of up to 5 to 30 meters per second are symptoms of the disease (normally greater than 40 to 45  meters per second). The progression of the disease is gradual and symptoms appear between the ages of 5 and 25 years. Less than 5% of patients become wheelchair  dependent. The disease usually does not shorten the life span. There are 6 types of CMT1 that are similar in clinical manifestations and can only be separated  by genetic testing. The gene involved and the mutations created in the subgroups of this disease are listed in (Table 2) [1-12].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">History of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome was first reported in 1886 by Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Marie, and Howard Henry Tooth [1,13].</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    <li>Asadi S (2018) Pathology in Medical Genetics Book.

That&rsquo;s how they do it 10 March 2020.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">A Global Report Warns: The Epidemic Could Kill 80 Million People in 36 Hours</h3>\r\n<p>The 2019 outbreak of the corona virus (COVID-19), formerly called the coronavirus virus (2019-nCoV), represents a new type of corona virus.  It causes respiratory illness and was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 can spread from person to person, usually passing through respiratory  droplets caused by coughing or sneezing. There are several different types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, including COVID-19, Middle Eastern  Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). As of March 4 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported at  least 80 approved COVID-19 cases in the United States, along with nine deaths in Washington state. Moreover, among the 13 states where the virus is,  California is now the center of attention (Figures 2 and 3).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Summary</h3>\r\n<p>On December 31, 2019, a cluster of unknown etiology pneumonia cases reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 9, 2020, China CDC reported  an innovative coronavirus as the cause of this outbreak, which is phylogenetic in the SARS-CoV dressing. The disease created with it is considered as  the 2019 Coronavirus Virus (COVID-19). As of March 2, 2020, at 8:00 am, more than 89,068 COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide, mainly in China  and all Chinese provinces; Of these cases, about 9,000 cases reported from other countries. As of March 2, 66 states have reported cases. The risk  associated with COVID-19 infection in people in the EU / EEA and the UK is now looked at to be moderate to high, based on the probability of transmitting  the disease.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Current Situation</h3>\r\n<p>Approximately 1,000 people were taken into quarantine at a house in West Einberg, Germany, when the virus started spreading throughout Germany [3].</p>\r\n<p>German media reported 14 new cases of infection in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany&rsquo;s most populous state, four in southern Baden-Wurttemberg and one  in Rhineland-Palatinate and Bavaria, bringing the total number of cases in Germany to 30. These are in addition to the 16 people who were confirmed to be  infected two weeks ago and are now free of the virus. Among the recent cases in Baden-Wurttemberg are two women and a man who attended a business meeting  in Munich. They are among the 13 people who have come in contact with an Italian man who has been tested positive for the Cornea virus in Italy.</p>\r\n<p>The confirmed case in Rhineland-Palatinate was recently in Iran and has been in contact with someone who appears to be showing symptoms of the disease.  The case in Bavaria was a person who had contact with an Italian who was infected with the virus. NRW currently has a total of 20 infections in the Corona  virus, and Baden-Wurttemberg 8. The 14 new NRW cases are being quarantined at home.</p>\r\n<p><b>Taiwan</b> confirmed on Friday that two more people were infected with the Coronavirus, raising its count to 34, Katherine Hill reports.</p>\r\n<p>One is a man in his 30s who started showing symptoms on February 25, three days after returning from a group tour of Japan. This is Taiwan&rsquo;s first  case of Covid-19 infection that was indeed imported from a country other than China.</p>\r\n<p>The second is a diabetic woman in her 50s who suffers from heart disease, spends most of her time at home and began showing symptoms a week after  hospitalization due to various complaints.</p>\r\n<p>The Taiwan Epidemic Management Center said that since none of its household members presented any symptoms, it will investigate their contact history  to determine the source of the infection.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Coronavirus Spreading in The USA for Weeks</h3>\r\n<p>Researchers who have examined the genome of two Corona virus infections in Washington state say the similarity of cases suggests that the virus may  have spread in the state for weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Washington was the first approved case of the United States for the Coronavirus, announced by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 20.  Based on the genetic sequencing of the virus, another case that sprang up in the country and was announced Friday would probably have dropped from that  first case [4].</p>\r\n<p>Both men live in the same district, but it is not known that they had any contact with each other, and the second case occurred long after the former  was no longer likely to be contagious. So the genetic findings show that the virus has spread through other people in the community for nearly six weeks,  according to one of the scientists who compared the sequences, Trevor Bedford, associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the  University of Washington.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Bedford said the two cases may not be related, and they were brought separately to the United States. However, he said it was unlikely, because  in both cases the virus contained a rare genetic variation - it was found in only two of the 59 samples whose sequences were distributed from China,  where the virus originated.</p>\r\n<p>The State of Israel has recently joined more than 80 countries around the world that are dealing with the COVID-19 virus - the recent-corona virus.  More than 3 months have passed since the virus first broke out in eastern China and since then, more than 97,000 people have been infected and more than  3,300 have already died.</p>\r\n<p>Many politicians have referred to the dangerous eruption, including Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it &ldquo;the most dangerous in the last 100 years.&rdquo;  It is no secret that the people of the globe are facing a very difficult period, but it is important to emphasize - this will not be the first time.</p>\r\n<p>They claim that if the influence of the Spanish influenza, a century ago took the lives of fifty million people around the world - in a hypothetical  case similar plague will occur today.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Why Are We Trying to Delay the Corona Instead of Letting It &ldquo;Hit&rdquo; Us and Pass Quickly?</h3>\r\n<p>The number of corona patients in Israel is rising, but government steps are in the meantime preventing uncontrolled expansion. If we manage to  moderate the rate of infection, we may find that the health system can cope with its climax (Figure 4).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">And What Will Happen After the Isolation Is Exhausted and Infectious Cases Begin to Emerge That Are Unclear as to Their Origin?</h3>\r\n<p>Then the next phase of &ldquo;social remoteness&rdquo; will take effect. Blitzer explains: &ldquo;The first stage in social distancing is the prevention of mass  gathering, such as games and music performances, because one such event can dramatically change the situation. They have already begun to do so  (ban on gathering of more than 5,000 people; RL) and I estimate That the numbers will decrease.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The next step will include a recommendation to close smaller gatherings, to theaters and small events. More advanced stages of social remoteness  are more profoundly violating daily life - changes in school, workplace and public transport - and these will come.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Health Estimates: &ldquo;We Will Reach Tens of Thousands of Corona Patients in Israel&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>Prof. Itamar Grotto made a gloomy outlook on the number of patients infected with the virus and strongly criticized the establishment of the  isolation unit for Corona patients in Tel Hashomer: &ldquo;This is an unnecessary presentation, has done more harm than good&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>This morning&rsquo;s news.</p>\r\n<p>The number of corona patients in Israel has risen to 25 this weekend, and this morning (Sunday), Professor Itamar Grotto, Deputy Director General  of the Ministry of Health, estimates that the number is expected to reach as many as thousands, if not tens of thousands of other patients in the country.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We estimate that we will reach thousands and even tens of thousands of patients, this cannot be prevented,&rdquo; Prof. Grotto revealed in &ldquo;The Morning News,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Not all tens of thousands of patients will go to hospitals, the majority will be treated in the community. 80 to 90 percent of patients will be ill  patients &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s going to happen to them, they just have to stay in solitary confinement until they get sick. They don&rsquo;t need special medical care.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There will be no shortage of food, Israel has proven it can get out of crises&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Dozens of Israelis have already been infected with the virus, tens of thousands have been isolated, and the Israeli economy, like the whole world,  fears a severe economic crisis and recession. How will this affect our pocket and whether Israel is preparing as required? The chief economist at the  Ministry of Finance arrived at the N12 studio and answered the users&rsquo; questions.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">A Global Report Warns: The Epidemic Could Kill 80 Million People in 36 Hours</h3>\r\n<p>Experts [5] warn of a global epidemic like that could kill 80 million people in just 36 hours. According to these experts, the ease with which people  fly around the world can contribute to faster spread of fatal infections.</p>\r\n<p>The paper was published GPMB (by the World Alert Supervisory Council), consisting of former World Health Organization expert teams, to lead leaders  from around the world to action. In a hypothetical case similar to today&rsquo;s epidemic, the consequences could be even more devastating, mainly because people  traveling the world frequently and the potential for expansion may be significantly higher.</p>\r\n<p>People should prepare themselves for the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in their community. The community can take measures to reduce the spread  of COVID-19 [6].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities There Is Currently No Vaccine or Drug Available for COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>Community-based interventions such as school layoffs, event cancellations, social distancing, and creating employee work programs remotely can help  slow COVID-19 spread. People can practice daily contraception such as frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, and coughing and sneezing.</p>\r\n<p>Decisions about implementing community measures will be made by local and state agencies, in consultation with federal agencies as needed, and based  on the extent of the outbreak and the severity of the disease. Implementation will require widespread community involvement, with ongoing communication  and public health transparency.</p>\r\n<p>Experts are probing whether the coronavirus can be spread through communal sewage systems after a Hong Kong high rise found 2cases10 floors apart.  SARS also spread via fecal matter during its 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of people in the city died in that outbreak. Authorities have since evacuated residents from the Hong Kong building. There have been 50  recorded cases of the coronavirus in Hong Kong, according to the...</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">South China Morning Post</h3>\r\n<p>Hong Kong Housing Minister Frank Chan said Tuesday that the city&rsquo;s public sewage system is safe, but pointed to an alteration that had been made  to one of the toilets, CNN reported. Tenants of public housing were only allowed to make adjustments to their sewage pipes in 2016, SCMP reported.  m an initial inspection into the estate&rsquo;s sewage system found that a pipe in the woman&rsquo;s apartment unit had been disconnected from the bathroom&rsquo;s  main waste pipe, CNN reported.

Two big dramas have come our way this week: The Knesset elections, which this time have also not been decided unequivocally and may extend the shuffle; And  the Corona crisis, which for the most part has &ldquo;made a rise&rdquo; without waiting for the voter to speak. The medical side of the crisis is also being addressed  during a transitional government. The thing is that from an economic point of view, as is happening all over the world, there are steps that are critical  and urgent. And here, the political paralysis may have a heavy price. First, what is happening in China. After weeks of paralysis, the Chinese economy  appears to be gradually returning to action. About 80% of the enterprises are slowly returning to work, although at a lower output 25% of the average.  On the other hand, vibrant trading cities in Europe still look like ghost towns, and the global aviation industry has trouble spreading wings [9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">State in Isolation: Airlines Continue to Cancel Lines to Israel</h3>\r\n<p>With the refinement of the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s guidelines and the inclusion of new countries in the list requiring insulation to return, more and  more foreign airlines are temporarily canceling the routes to Tel Aviv and Ramon Airport.

And it is known for the science of these  mutations cannot disappear. Here are some of the ones that have &ldquo;recuperated&rdquo;. Japan, China, and this is the main concern today in all of Europe.</p>\r\n<p>For Israel it is a particularly difficult situation. 60 thousand are currently quarantined. Although doctors are confidently treating their corona  patient, they do not know much about the virus and give regular treatment to the patient&rsquo;s situation, especially in children&rsquo;s care, but the facts show  that the situation worsens. Israel will be cut off from the world. Its citizens must exercise the utmost care regarding these patients. And the most  important thing: do not downplay this patient. Virus will disappear from the world. But one must prepare for the worst and I wish and will not materialize ....</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Concluding Remarks</h3>\r\n<p>Doctors and health care providers do what they can to treat patients.</p>\r\n<p>The scientific world has been in Corona for 6 decades and knows this virus family in depth. Many of these viruses, scientific articles and books  [11-13] have been published on these viruses, but there is no cure for the diseases it causes. Many are recovering but many are also now dead, accounting  for about 3-4 percent of the virus. Especially elderly people in the 70s and 80s. This is a death that has no cure and no vaccine. Biotechnology is  lagging behind in this case. Humanity has invested in computers but neglected to treat this virus and is now called to pay the price in Calcutta and  in the lives of its elderly.</p>\r\n<p>And as Jacob said in his blessing: &ldquo;For your salvation I call upon the name of God.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Coronaviruses are pathogens that have a severe impact on human and animal health. They most often cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can  be difficult and life-threatening, for example in the case of zoonotic coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle  Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. Despite the economic and social impact of these types of virus infections and the likelihood of future  outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options for preventing or treating infections in the coronavirus virus remain very limited. This  highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on replication of these viruses and their interaction with the host. Compared to other RNA + viruses,  coronaviruses have a particularly large genome and use a complex genome expression strategy. Alongside a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly,  many of the virus proteins described in the infected cell contribute to the host-host interaction. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create  an optimal environment for coronavirus virus replication, by altering host gene expression or by host antiviral defenses. These host-virus interactions  are key to viral pathogenesis and ultimately determine the outcome of the infection. Because of the complexity of the proteome cycle and the replication  of the virus, our knowledge of hosts involved in Coronavirus replication is still early on compared to what is known in some other RNA viruses. This  summarizes our current understanding of host-virus-infected cell-level interactions, with special attention to assembly and function.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been two months since China announced a previously unknown virus Has been identified as causing a new outbreak in Wuhan city. In the weeks since  Corona Viv virus - now known as SARS-CoV2 - ran around the world igniting the major Outbreaks in Iran, South Korea ~ Italy, Japan and now, it seems, Seattle.  There are still many questions about this virus and the disease it causes, cubid-19. But in just a few weeks, several features of the disease have come  into focus Particularly fast sharing in research. &ldquo;Eight weeks into Cubid-19, there is quite a lot we learn,&rdquo; Maria van Kirchova, who heads the World  Health Organization&rsquo;s disease and zoonoses unit, said in The last interview. (Zoonoses are diseases that jump to people from animals.)</p>\r\n<p>South Korean officials set up &ldquo;drive-through&rdquo; Coronavirus virus screening facilities [14]. Manufacturers in China have the ability to distribute  more than a million and a half tests a week. The countries, alongside Italy and the United Kingdom, are testing tens of thousands of people for the  coronavirus, in many cases processing thousands of samples a day.</p>\r\n<p>In the United States, meanwhile, inadequate coronavirus testing has become a complete scandal. As U.S. cases increase, the Department of Health and  Human Services has launched an investigation into faulty test kits that have delayed lab results for several days, and experts fear a slow federal  response may have given the virus more time to spread.</p>\r\n<p>While health officials are fighting to stop the outbreak of coronavirus, researchers in China say preliminary studies show that COVID-19 is altered  and there are at least two types of the virus [15].</p>\r\n<p>One of those, the more aggressive strain, infected 70% of the people tested, while a less aggressive strain was associated with the rest, according  to doctors at the Peking University School of Life Sciences and the Pasteur Institute in Shanghai.</p>\r\n<p>World health experts argue that the speed and scale of Korea&rsquo;s innovative diagnostic capabilities in South Korea show remarkable and significant  laboratory capabilities that no other country, including the United States, can currently accommodate.</p>\r\n<p>South Korea tested a total of 66,652 people in the Corvav-19 virus as of 4 p.m. Local time on Thursday, while Japan reported giving about 1,890 tests  and the US only 445. The huge discrepancy compared to other countries reflects how quickly South Korea&rsquo;s numbers have risen, experts say.</p>\r\n<p>The total number of cases approved so far in South Korea is 1,766, up 505 from the previous day. Of the 66,00 people tested, more than 25,000 are still  awaiting lab results [16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Has The COVID-19 Mutated?</h3>\r\n<p>Complicating matters when it comes to vaccine development is the fact that COVID-19 has mutated. Scientists have confirmed that the virus has evolved  into two strains: &lsquo;type L&rsquo; and &lsquo;type S&rsquo;. The L-type can spread rapidly and scientists from the Peking University School of Life Sciences and the Pasteur  Institute in Shanghai say it can be more aggressive. The S and L mutations in COVID-19 were in the &ldquo;virus&rdquo; of the virus, said Dr. Stephen Griffin, of the  Leeds Institute of Medical Research and chair of the virus division at the Microbiology Society. The spine plays a major role in the infection process  and is aimed at the vaccines. Around 35 labs and institutions are developing a vaccine with several ready for human trials next month. Dr. Griffin said  developers would need to check if their prototyping vaccines could still neutralize viruses through the mutations, which may not constitute a &ldquo;huge hurdle&rdquo;  because the variations were &ldquo;quite limited.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Genetic analysis of a U.S. person who tested positive for COVID-19 in January showed that both mutations can be infected. Professor of Virology  Jonathan Ball said the mutations could interfere with vaccine production and that Chinese scientists&rsquo; findings would need to be studied using a larger  sample of cases because the data set used was small. Professor Ball said: &ldquo;We currently have no hard evidence that the virus has any changes in the  severity of the disease or infection, so we must be careful when interpreting these types of computer-based studies, however interesting.&rdquo; The Chinese  study analyzed DNA from 103 infected people and reported that the S type is taking over, possibly as a result of the tough locking measures imposed by  the Chinese authorities [17].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Eurovision Is Also in Danger: Because of The Corona They Are Considering Holding the Competition Without a Crowd</h3>\r\n<p>The European Broadcasting Union announced this morning that it is exploring alternatives for holding a singing competition, one of the options at  stake: holding the event without a crowd.

Its research requires access to the blood of people who have recovered from the respiratory disease or who have been vaccinated,  once a vaccine is developed, Takeda said.</p>\r\n<p>How will a mutation of the radiant virus affect us?</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the only direct effect is on those who catch the Coronus virus because it depends on what strain the virus is experiencing.</p>\r\n<p>The more aggressive type of virus is more often seen in Vaughan, but researchers say the frequency of the same type diminishes. This type is considered  the one that can spread too quickly. However, the researchers emphasize the early days of the findings.

Kahlon added: &ldquo;We have regular status assessments with the Prime Minister, the NSC and the Ministry of Health and  will respond as promptly as necessary.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>COVID 19 (Coronavirus crisis) causes the rapid growth in work from home? Well, there is a certain temptation to work from home. Employees do not have  to deal with traffic loads, they can save on transport costs and other expenses that come with physical labor and this helps to improve work-life balance.  At the same time, employers can drastically reduce company overhead, attract top candidates and enjoy the benefits of a more relaxed and happy workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, according to Global Workplace Analytics, a consulting firm, &ldquo;Normal-at-home work, among the non-self-employed population, has grown about  140% since 2005, almost 10 times faster than the rest of the workforce or self-employed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>However, not everyone has been successful. A host of organizations - such as Yahoo, IBM, Atna, Best Buy and the New York Mellon Hotel Bank - made  headlines when they announced that they would return to their communications phone for the job site.</p>\r\n<p>Why the face-about? According to the Human Resources Management Association, this could be because:</p>\r\n<p>Employees who do not receive the training and resources they need to do their job remotely.</p>\r\n<p>Non-trained supervisors required to manage and supervise remote workers (Figure 8) [19].</p>\r\n<p>Supervisors are more comfortable with on-site employees, perhaps because it makes them feel more in control or because they don&rsquo;t trust their  employees to work off-site.</p>\r\n<p>Employee productivity declines as they work off-site.</p>\r\n<p>With the phenomenon of home-based work being done for some employers but not others, how can you tell if it is right for your business?  Here are some tips to help you decide:</p>\r\n<p>&bull;Make sure the work can be done from home. For example, if the job requires the use of specialized equipment under direct supervision, regular  face-to-face meetings with clients, or intensive collaboration with co-workers, it may not be possible to do this effectively from home.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Evaluate the employee to determine if he or she is responsible and disciplined enough to work from home. Consider that not every employee  wants to work from home, which does not mean that they are not good workers. They are simply not suitable for home work arrangements.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Perform cost-benefit analysis. Potential costs may include one-off implementation costs, management costs, lodging costs, and recurring annual  costs. Potential benefits may include higher employee output, decreased sick leave, lower turnover rate and increased overhead savings.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Determine if you can overcome potential obstacles, such as addressing the social needs of remote workers; Developing an impartial performance  appraisal system; Management of technical support issues; Ensuring compliance with federal, state, and local employment laws; And monitoring the  effectiveness of your home-based work plan.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The decision to allow employees to work from home should be made after an extensive review of your situation. Obtain a top-down purchase to  secure input from key stakeholders, including employees and rating and file workers. You may also want to consult with labor law experts who can  explain the legality of allowing your employees to work from home.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Milan Under Curfew &ndash; COVID 19 Pandemic</h3>\r\n<p>Italians are no strangers to drama, but the radiation virus here - which killed more than 230, infested nearly 6,000 and brought our dynamic city  to a standstill - has alerted the hardest Italians to their core.</p>\r\n<p>Every aspect of daily life here in Milan has changed since the virus about two weeks ago.</p>\r\n<p>On Friday, outside the main cathedral of Milan, the Duomo, there were more pigeons than people in the plaza.

He said the possibility of a  widespread outbreak in the country should not be taken lightly - and then the entire public will have to join the fight as educational institutions,  social events and public transport are completely.</p>\r\n<p>This morning, the Italian prime minister announced a general closure in 14 northern and provincial cities and towns. According to Prof. Leshem,  a similar reality may exist in Israel in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The public in the state will have to make adjustments to prevent the health system from flooding the patients,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These adjustments will  include a reduction in activity that leads to contact between many people. For example, closing schools and universities for a few months, canceling  sporting events, parties and family events and ceasing public transport.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These are things that can be met,&rdquo; Professor Leshem continued. &ldquo;The goal will be to allow doctors to treat the severely ill. If we do not take  these measures, and the hospitals are inundated with the severely ill - then we will come to an apocalyptic scenario. Since the health system is  taking these steps now, we will be able to cope. There will be difficult cases and the doctors will be in a big load, but we will overcome This.  The public will bear the burden. &quot;</p>\r\n<p>According to Professor Leshem, the key element in the fight against the virus is public cooperation: &ldquo;In our mind we need to understand that this  is a public effort to deal with an emergency. This morning, the Ministry of Health has published tens of thousands of cases, and we may indeed experience  a sharp rise in the outbreak. The Ministry of Health must prepare for the emergency and thus reduce its severity. &quot;</p>\r\n<p>Prof. Leshem also emphasizes that the seemingly harsh restrictions have in fact proved to be the right and required course of action. &ldquo;You can see  in China that once they close schools and public transport, and people come into their homes, the disease has waned,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll see that  happen in Italy, too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I excitedly read the achievements in the developing of a vaccine to cure disease caused by the lethal and elusive corona virus at Tel Hai College.

Antimicrobial susceptibility is often tested against single bacterial isolates; this approach ignores interactions between cohabiting bacteria that could impact  susceptibility. Here, we use Pooled Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing to compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns exhibited by polymicrobial and monomicrobial  urine specimens obtained from patients with urinary tract infection symptoms.</p>\r\n<p><b>Methods:</b> Urine samples were collected from patients who had symptoms consistent with a urinary tract infection. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing was performed to identify and quantify 31 bacterial species. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using a novel Pooled Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing method. Antibiotic resistance rates in polymicrobial specimens were compared with those in monomicrobial infections. Using a logistic model, resistance rates were estimated when specific bacterial species were present. To assess interactions between pairs of bacteria, the predicted resistance rates were compared when a pair of bacterial species were present versus when just one bacterial species was present.</p>\r\n<p><b>Results:</b> Urine specimens were collected from 3,124 patients with symptoms of urinary tract infection. Of these, multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing detected bacteria in 61.1% (1910) of specimens. Pooled Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing results were available for 70.8% (1352) of these positive specimens. Of these positive specimens, 43.9% (594) were monomicrobial, while 56.1% (758) were polymicrobial. The odds of resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.005), amoxicillin/clavulanate (p = 0.008), five different cephalosporins, vancomycin (p = &lt;0.0001), and tetracycline (p = 0.010) increased with each additional species present in a polymicrobial specimen. In contrast, the odds of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam decreased by 75% for each additional species present (95% CI 0.61, 0.94, p = 0.010). For one or more antibiotics tested, thirteen pairs of bacterial species exhibited statistically significant interactions compared with the expected resistance rate obtained with the Highest Single Agent Principle and Union Principle.</p>\r\n<p><b>Conclusion: </b>Bacterial interactions in polymicrobial specimens can result in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns that are not detected when bacterial isolates are tested by themselves. Optimizing an effective treatment regimen for patients with polymicrobial infections may depend on accurate identification of the constituent species, as well as results obtained by Pooled Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Urinary Tract Infection; Antibiotic Susceptibility; Polymicrobial; Microbiome; Diagnostic Test; Microbiota;  Clinical Microbiology; Bacterial Interactions; Statistical Models</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>The standard of care for diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) is a Standard Urine Culture (SUC) along with antimicrobial susceptibility testing,  and has served to guide treatment since the early 1950s. The methodology relies on an <em>&ldquo;Escherichia coli (E. coli)</em>-centric&rdquo;  view that perceives UTIs as caused by one or two pathogens[1]. Recent findings, however, reveal that SUC often misses the vast majority of urinary tract organisms  and uropathogens[2]. This deficiency limits potentially valuable information that should be provided to the treating clinicians. The nomenclature and basic concepts  of UTI are based on the now disproven dogma that the lower urinary tract is sterile. Even though the mere presence of an organism should not  automatically prompt antibiotic treatment, clinicians will likely benefit from a more comprehensive report of organisms present in the urine samples from symptomatic  patients.</p>\r\n<p>With this clinical need in mind, we recently developed a Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (M-PCR)-based urinary organism detection and analysis method. with primers and probes explicitly designed against 31 commonly identified UTI-associated bacteria species, the test not only identify positive organism(s) but also calculate each of their concentrations in the urine,  and has a faster turnaround time than SUC[3].</p>\r\n<p>In parallel, antibiotic resistance has been well-studied in monomicrobial infections, but is less characterized in polymicrobial infections. It has been reported  that up to 39% of UTI infections are polymicrobial in nature [2-4]. Cological interactions are found to be potentially crucial for the growth and survival of bacteria  in polymicrobial communities. Even if not all of the organisms are directly pathogenic and associated with UTI symptoms, the interactions among different species of  bacteria can alter responses to antibiotics in polymicrobial settings, which may have potentially significant clinical impacts [5-8].</p>\r\n<p>Current Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) ignores bacterial interactions: each bacterium is tested in isolation against an antibiotic, providing no  opportunity to assess bacterial interactions. Ignoring bacterial interactions can either lead to potential treatment failure or prevent the use of efficacious  antibiotics. Both scenarios can have serious clinical consequences. Here, we introduce a novel method called Pooled Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (P-AST),  (patent number 10,160,991), which involves simultaneously growing all detected bacteria together in the presence of antibiotics and then measuring susceptibility.  Thus, P-AST considers interactions between cohabiting bacterial species. We obtained urine specimens from patients presenting with UTI-like symptoms to 37 urology  clinics. First, we estimated the odds of resistance to 18 antibiotics or antibiotic combinations relative to increasing numbers of bacterial species in a specimen.  We found that antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in polymicrobial specimens differed from those observed in monomicrobial specimens. Since standard of care  relies on assessment of antibiotic susceptibility in monomicrobial infections, these findings show that P-AST could serve as a more accurate predictor of  antibiotic susceptibility.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Patient participation and sample handling</h3>\r\n<p>This study combines data from two studies of antibiotic resistance patterns in elderly patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a UTI. Retrospective data and patient information (Western IRB number 20171870) were obtained from a single site (Comprehensive Urology, Royal Oak, MI) for 613 patients who presented between March and July 2018. Prospective data and patient information (Western IRB number 20181661) were obtained for 2,511 patients who presented at any of 37 geographically disparate clinics in the United States between July 2018 and February 2019. All subjects met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria included: symptoms of acute cystitis, complicated UTI, persistent UTI, recurrent UTI, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, interstitial cystitis (at any age), symptoms of other conditions at &ge;60 years of age, specimen volumes sufficient to permit urine culture and Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (M-PCR) combined with Pooled Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing (P-AST), patient informed consented, documented times at which the specimens were collected and stabilized with boric acid in grey-top tubes. Exclusion criteria included prior participation in this study, antibiotics taken for any reason other than UTI at the time of enrollment, chronic (&gt;10 days) indwelling catheters, self-catheterization, and urinary diversion. Antibiotic susceptibility data were available for 1,352 of the 3,124 patients (43.3%).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">DNA extraction and analysis</h3>\r\n<p>DNA extraction was performed using the KingFisher/MagMAX&trade; Automated DNA Extraction instrument and the MagMAX&trade; DNA Multi-Sample Ultra  Kit (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA). 400 &mu;L of urine were transferred to 96-well deep-well plates, sealed, and centrifuged to concentrate the samples,  and then the supernatant was removed. Enzyme Lysis Mix (220 &mu;L/well) was added to the samples, which were then incubated for 20 min at 65&ordm;C.  Proteinase K Mix (PK Mix) was added (50 &mu;L/well) and incubated for 30 min at 65&ordm;C. Lysis buffer (125 &mu;L/well) and DNA Binding Bead Mix (40 &mu;L/well)  were added, and the samples were vortexed for a minimum of 5 min. Each 96-well plate was loaded into the KingFisher/MagMAX Automated DNA Extraction instrument,  which was operated in accordance with standard operating procedures.</p>\r\n<p>DNA analysis was conducted using the Guidance&reg; UTI Test (Pathnostics, Irvine, CA). . Samples were mixed with universal PCR master mix and amplified using TaqMan technology on the Life Technologies 12K Flex OpenArray System&trade; (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). DNA samples were spotted in duplicate on 112-format OpenArray chips. Plasmids unique to each bacterial species being tested were used as positive controls. Candida tropicalis was used as an inhibition control. A data analysis tool developed by Pathnostics was used to sort data, assess the quality of data, summarize control sample data, identify positive assays, calculate concentrations, and generate draft reports. Probes and primers were used to detect the following bacteria through M-PCR: A. baumannii, A. schaalii, A. urinae, A. omnicolens, C. freundii, C. koseri, C. riegelii, K. aerogenes, E. faecalis, E. coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, M. morganii, M. tuberculosis, M. genitalium, M. hominis, P. agglomerans, P. mirabilis, P. stuartii, P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, and U. urealyticum. Probes and primers also were used to detect the following bacterial groups: Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus); Viridans group streptococci (VGS) (S. anginosus, S. oralis, S. pasteuranus). The quantities of each of the detected bacterial species were determined using the standard curve method: first, standard curves of each of the bacterial species were generated from testing replicates of dilution series of known concentrations of each of the calibrator bacteria; constants necessary for the quantitation of each of the bacterial species in unknown samples, such as slope and intercept, were established from each of the standard curves; then PCR Ct values of a target bacteria species from an unknown sample were compared to the standard curve, and the concentration of the target bacteria species (cells/ul) present in an unknown sample was extrapolate and determined. Bacteria with quantity of &gt;10,000 cells/mL were defined as positive, and bacteria with quantity &lt; 10,000 cells/mL were defined as negative.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Pooled - Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing</h3>\r\n<p>P-AST was performed by aliquoting 1 mL of patient urine specimen into a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated and discarded, leaving approximately 500 &mu;L of patient sample in the microcentrifuge tube. One mL of Mueller Hinton Growth Media was then aliquoted into the patient sample in the microcentrifuge tube and the tubes were incubated at 35&ordm;C in a non-CO2 incubator for 6 hours. Mueller Hinton Agar was used as a negative control. Those samples that reached a minimum threshold of 10,000 cells/mL were then diluted by aliquoting 0.5 mL of sample into a 50 mL conical tube containing Mueller Hinton Growth Media. 96-well plates pre-loaded with antibiotics were then inoculated with diluted samples and incubated along Citation: Vollstedt A, Baunoch D, Wolfe A, Luke N, Wojno KJ, et al.

Optical density of samples was then read on a DensiCHEK plate reader&trade; (BioMerieux, Marcy-l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile, France).</p>\r\n<p>AST is currently unavailable for P. agglomerans, U. urealyticum, A. schaalii, A. urinae, A. omnicolens, C. riegelii, M. hominis, and M. genitalium, M. tuberculosis, S. anginosus, U. urealyticum, and VGS, due to fastidious in vitro growth characteristics.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Statistical Methods</h3>\r\n<p>Logistic regression was used to compare resistance rates in monomicrobial and polymicrobial infections. Specifically,18 different logistic regression models were fit to the data: the response variable was an indicator of whether the specimen was resistant to the specific antibiotic or not and the predictor variable was an indicator of whether the infection was monomicrobial or polymicrobial. Specimens were classified as monomicrobial if a single bacterial species was detected above the 10000 cells/mL threshold; they were classified as polymicrobial if two or more distinct bacteria species were detected above that threshold. Similar logistic regression models also were run, using the number of distinct bacterial species as the predictor variable.</p>\r\n<p>Interactions between pairs of bacterial species were investigated using a logistic regression model to predict resistance in the presence of specific bacterial species. In this model, the response was an indicator variable of resistance and the predictor variables were 16 indicators of the presence of the following bacterial species or groups that tested positive in at least 30 samples; these were A. schaalii, A. urinae, A. omnicolens, CoNS, C. riegelii, E. faecalis, E. coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, M. morganii, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, U. urealyticum, and VGS. A backward stepwise model selection was performed on the model with all main effects and all pairwise interactions using an enter significance level of &alpha;=0.10 and an exit significance level of &alpha;=0.05 to obtain the best fitting model. This model was used to predict resistance rates when a specific bacterial species was present or when a specific pair of species was present.</p>\r\n<p>Using the logistic regression model described above, the resistance rate for a pair of species was compared to the resistance rates for each species alone. Two different principles were applied to calculate the expected resistance rate to a pair of species that do not interact: (a) Highest Single Agent Principle (HSAP) (a commonly used model for drug interactions) and (b) Union Principle (UP) (also used to model drug interactions).</p>\r\n<p>Using the HSAP, a pair of species was considered to have an interaction if the resistance rate of the pair of species was statistically different from  the highest resistance rate of each of the two species alone. This model is based on the idea that a pooled specimen containing two species will survive application of a specific antibiotic only if the more resistant species survives. When an antibiotic is applied to the pool, it may kill off species A, but if species B survives, the pool is called resistant.</p>\r\n<p>The UP assumes a pair of bacteria (species A and B) is made up of one genetic variant of species A and one genetic variant of species B, and that the pool is resistant if either species A is resistant or if species B is resistant. If species A is resistant with probability , and species B is resistant with probability , then the probability of resistance of the pool is:</p>\r\n<p>This assumes the two species do not interact, and therefore act independently.</p>\r\n<p>Interactions were statistically tested using bootstrapped samples of the 1,352 patients with antibiotic resistance results; each patient was randomly selected with replacement. A logistic regression with terms in the best fitting model selected as above was fit to each bootstrapped sample. The predicted resistance when the pair of species was present was compared to the predicted resistance to each species alone using the model fit to the bootstrap sample (assuming either the HSAP or UP). 5000 bootstrapped samples were generated and analyzed. If 97.5% or greater of the bootstrapped samples demonstrated a pool resistance higher than expected, the interaction was deemed to show a statistically significant interaction with increased resistance. If 97.5% or greater of the bootstrapped samples demonstrated a pool resistance lower than expected, the interaction was deemed to show a statistically significant interaction with decreased resistance.</p>\r\n<p>Since resistance testing is not generally performed for monomicrobial infections of the following bacterial species, interactions with these species or groups were not tested: P. agglomerans, U. urealyticum, A. schaalii, A. urinae, A. omnicolens, C. riegelii, M. hominis, and M. genitalium, M. tuberculosis, S. anginosus, U. urealyticum, and VGS.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>A total of 3,124 patients, from two studies and from 37 geographically disparate urology clinics in the United States, presenting with symptoms consistent with a UTI, were initially included in the study. P-AST data were available for 43.3% (1352) of these patients (Figure 1). The demographics and presenting symptoms for these 1352 patients are presented in Table 1. Their mean age was 75 years. Sixty-six percent (887/1,352) were female, whereas 34% (465/1,352) male.</p>\r\n<p>By M-PCR, 38.9% (1,214/3,124) of the specimens were negative for bacteria, whereas 61.1% (1,910/3,124) were positive. P-AST data were available for 1,352 (70.7%)  of these 1,910 positive specimens,. Of these 1,352 specimens, 43.9% (594/1,352) were monomicrobial, whereas 56.1% (758/1,352) were polymicrobial.</p>\r\n<p>(1) no species were detected at &ge; 10,000 cells/mL (correlating to colony forming units/mL) and thus no species were tested against antibiotics;</p>\r\n<p>(2) the species detected by PCR were fastidious (i.e., they required specific growth conditions, extremely restrictive growth conditions, or extreme length of time  in order to perform susceptibility testing);</p>\r\n<p>(3) prior antimicrobial use caused bacteria to fail to thrive in the P-AST assay; or</p>\r\n<p>(4) species were not identified because the M-PCR reaction was inhibited. M-PCR inhibition can occur when an interfering substance prevents the amplification and subsequent detection of the PCR product associated with targeted DNA.</p>\r\n<p>Odds ratios of antibiotic resistance in polymicrobial versus monomicrobial specimens are shown in Table 2, along with the odds ratio of resistance for each increase in the number of bacterial species in polymicrobial specimens. The resistance rates of polymicrobial samples were generally higher than the rates of monomicrobial samples; 10 of 18 antibiotics or antibiotic combinations had statistically higher resistance rates for polymicrobial samples. The odds of resistance for each additional species identified in a polymicrobial specimen increased for ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, five of the six of the cephalosporins tested, vancomycin, and tetracycline. The opposite was true for piperacillin/tazobactam, where each additional species in a polymicrobial specimen resulted in a 75% decrease in the odds of resistance (95% CI 0.61, 0.94, p = 0.01).</p>\r\n<p>Table 3 shows the effect of specific species interactions on the probability of increased or decreased resistance to each antibiotic tested. No interactions were de tected for nitrofurantoin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Whereas the odds of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, 6 different cephalosporins, vancomycin,  and tetracycline increased with increasing number of detected species, There were 19 instances for which 11 of the 13 bacterial pairs resulted in reduced  susceptibility to the same antibiotics.</p>\r\n<p>Using HSAP, there were 44 instances for which 13 pairs of bacteria showed statistically significant interactions that either increased or decreased the probability of resistance to the antibiotics tested. According to the HSAP principle, most interactions resulted in a decreased probability of resistance. Only 6/44 (13.6%) pairings resulted in increased odds of antibiotic resistance, whereas a decreased probability occurred in 38/44 (86.4%) of  pairings.</p>\r\n<p>The bacterial combinations that increased the probability of antibiotic resistance according to the HSAP model were E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae (amoxicillin/clavulanate, p = 0.02 and ampicillin/sulbactam, p = 0.03), E. coli and K. pneumoniae (ampicillin/sulbactam, p = 0.04 and cefaclor, p = 0.05), CoNS and E. coli and (levofloxacin, p &lt; 0.001), E. faecalis and S. agalactiae (tetracycline,  p &lt; 0.001).</p>\r\n<p>The UP model identified 49 statistically significant interactions, all of which showed decreased probability of resistance to the antibiotics tested.</p>\r\n<p>To illustrate the model, one specific pair is presented in graphical form. Figure 2 shows the predicted probabilities of resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefaclor, and tetracycline by monomicrobial positive cultures for E. coli and K. pneumoniae and a polymicrobial culture positive for both E. coli and K. pneumoniae. When the HSAP model was used, the pairing of E. coli and K. pneumoniae resulted in either a significant increase or significant decrease in the probability of resistance depending on the antibiotic tested. For example,when ampicillin/sulbactam or cefaclor was applied to the the combination of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the resistance rate was higher than either E. coli or K. pneumoniae alone. In contrast, the resistance rate to tetracycline of the same combination of species, E. coli and K. pneumoniae, was intermediate between  the resistance rates to each species alone.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>These results demonstrate that polymicrobial infections, which constituted 56.1% (758/1,352) of positive samples with susceptibility results, can alter response to antibiotics. This alteration in susceptibility is associated with specific bacterial combinations, the antibiotic tested and the number of bacteria in the polymicrobial sample.</p>\r\n<p>There is a growing concern that the number of multiresistant strains of bacteria is increasing despite the addition of antibiotic stewardship programs. In the polymicrobial sample, we see the effect of the increased resistance due to the presence of multiple resistance genes in that the odds of resistance increased per each organism added for 2 penicillin antibiotics, 5 cephalosporine, vancomycin, and tetracycline. Previous studies show that clinical isolates can protect other species from antibiotics with various interactions demonstrating a higher than a 3.5-fold increase in antimicrobial tolerance [8]. In the case of penicillin&rsquo;s and cephalosporins, the whole population may be protected by the ability of a single resistant bacteria species, by breaking down the penicillin or cephalosporine with &beta;-lactamase inhibitor [9]. The likelihood of the polymicrobial sample containing such a protective species increases with each additional bacterial species added to the polymicrobial mix. Additionally, antibiotic resistance can be conferred by one bacterium on another bacterium through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes</p>\r\n<p>Increasing the complexity of the interactions, thirteen specific bacterial pairs had one or more significant interactions when tested in the presence of 16 of the 18 antibiotics or antibiotic combinations using HSAP and UP. Of these interactions, 38 resulted in a decreased probability of resistance, while 6 resulted in an increased probability of resistance. The combination of E. coli and K. pneumoniae resulted in an increased probability of resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and cefaclor, but decreased probability of resistance to tetracycline. E. faecalis together with K. pneumoniae resulted in increased resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam, but decreased resistance to levofloxacin,meropenem, and tetracycline. E. faecalis combined with S. agalactiae produced an increase in resistance to tetracycline, but decreased resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin. Similarly, the combination of CoNS and E. coli produced an increased probability in resistance to levofloxacin, but the same combination produced a decreased probability in resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. These differences may be attributed to the unique mechanisms of action of the specific antibiotics.</p>\r\n<p>A similar set of contrasts is observed from the perspective of individual antibiotics. Different pairs of bacteria caused both increased and decreased resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefaclor, levofloxacin, and tetracycline. For instance, E. coli combined with K. pneumoniae produced an increase in resistance to cefaclor, while E. coli combined with P. mirabilis produced a decrease in resistance to cefaclor. These results highlight the importance of accurate identification of bacteria in polymicrobial infections: a difference in identification of one species can influence antibiotic resistance.</p>\r\n<p>The observed effects on antibiotic resistance in polymicrobial infections may be due to cooperative and/or competitive interactions between bacteria. Resistant bacteria can cooperatively protect susceptible bacteria by degrading antibiotics, as occurs when secreted beta-lactamase degrades beta-lactam antibiotics [11]. Antibiotic resistance can be conferred by one bacterium on another bacterium by means of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes [10]. Bacterial interactions with host macrophages can promote HGT. For instance, P. aeruginosa, when present in biofilms, produces extracellular DNA that induces neutrophils to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and IL-1 beta). The ensuing inflammation can promote HGT involving E. coli [12]. Interestingly, some antibiotics can also promote HGT: antibiotics that cause bacterial lysis release DNA and proteins that can be taken up by other bacteria [12]. In addition, one bacterium can stimulate gene expression in another bacterium, resulting in upregulation of efflux pumps leading to increased antibiotic resistance [7]. Bacterial community spatial structuring within a polymicrobial biofilm may also affect the efficacy of antibiotics [13,14].</p>\r\n<p>Decreased resistance to antibiotics in polymicrobial specimens may also be due to competitive mechanisms between bacteria. P. aeruginosa has been  documented to produce antibiotics, whereas Enterococcus species produce and secrete bacteriocins [15,16]. Gram-negative bacteria have developed a number of specialized  secretion systems that can perform protective functions. Type V secretion systems secrete proteases that digest IgA, surface receptors that bind the constant region  of IgG, and virulence factor/adhesin proteins that promote colonization [17-20]. Type VI secretion systems allow Gram-negative bacteria to secrete antibacterial  toxins directly into other bacteria [21,22]. At the same time, Type VI systems mediate DNA acquisition via HGT; an example is the capacity for A.  baumannii to rapidly acquire resistance genes from E. coli by means of Type VI transfer systems [23,24].</p>\r\n<p>One type of bacterial interaction can cause a paradoxical result: cross-feeding between bacteria can produce decreased antibiotic resistance. This may explain our observed decreased probability of antibiotic resistance seen in most specific organism combinations. Cross-feeding is a process by which one organism produces metabolites that promote the survival of another organism [25,26]. However, this interaction can produce a chain of dependencies, leaving the entire chain only as resistant as the most susceptible bacterium. Adamowicz et al. [7] showed that bacterial species were inhibited at significantly lower antibiotic concentrations in cross-feeding communities than in monoculture, coined as the &ldquo;weakest link&rdquo; model.</p>\r\n<p>None of these potentially important changes of drug responses would be captured through routine ATS testings done on bacterium in isolation. There is growing evidence that testing the bacterium in association with other organisms may improve clinical outcomes. In a retrospective research study involving 66,383 subjects cared for by house-call health care physicians, subjects with possible UTI were split into 2 cohorts; one treated based upon the results from SUC and an assay incorporating P-AST. The complete number of emergency department and hospitalization visits were compared. The P-AST cohort was associated with a significant decrease in hospital admissions and/or emergency department as compard to the SUC cohort [27].</p>\r\n<p>Strengths of the study include the large number of samples coming from multiple urology clinics across the United States. Additionally, interactions were analyzed using specimens collected from the clinical setting.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Bacteria are social organisms that interact within and between species. Key interactions play critical roles in the growth, pathogenesis, and virulence of bacterial species. Because of these key and specific interactions, correct identification of bacterial species increases in significance. In order to accurately assess these interactions and provide clinical context, we have developed P-AST, a pooled antibiotic susceptibility test. Using this methodology, we observed both increased and decreased antibiotic susceptibility based on the type of species observed, as well as the class of antibiotic administered. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which alterations in antibiotic response occur in polymicrobial infections will require additional research. Based on these findings, P-AST testing might more closely approximate the polymicrobial environment in the patient and possibly provide more clinically important information regarding antibiotic susceptibility. Clinical studies will need to be conducted and are underway to analyze clinical outcome benefits and/or cost effectiveness if results from the P-AST testing are to impact clinical antibiotic selections.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgment</h3>\r\n<p>Funding for this project was provided by Pathnostics, Inc.

While the novel coronavirus threatens people&rsquo;s lives and safety, the economies of various countries have also  been severely damaged. Due to the epidemic, a large number of enterprises have faced closures, employment has become more difficult, and people&rsquo;s lives  have been greatly affected. Therefore, to establish a time series model for Hubei Province, where the novel coronavirus first broke out, and the United  States, where the epidemic is most severe, to analyze the spreading trend and short-term forecast of the new coronavirus, which will help countries  better understand the development trend of the epidemic and make more adequate preparation and timely intervention and treatment to prevent the further  spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<p><b>Methods: </b>For the data collected from Hubei Province, including cumulative diagnoses, cumulative deaths, and cumulative cures, we use SPSS  to establish the time series model. Since there is no problem of missing data values, we define days as the time variable, remove outliers, and set  the width of the confidence interval to 95% for prediction, then use SPSS&rsquo;s expert modeler to find the best-fit model for each sequence. ACF, PACF  graphs of the residuals, and Q-tests are used to determine whether the residuals are white noise sequences and to check whether the model is a suitable  model. Holt model is used for the cumulative number of diagnoses, and ARIMA (1,2,0) model is used for cumulative cures and deaths. Similarly, we also  collect data for the US, including the cumulative number of diagnoses, cumulative deaths, and cumulative cures. For the three groups mentioned above,  ARIMA (2,2,6) model, ARIMA (0,2,0) model, and ARIMA (0,2,1) model are used respectively.</p>\r\n<p><b>Findings: </b>From our modeling of the data, the time series diagrams of the real the fitted data almost overlap, so the fitting effect of the  Holt model and the ARIMA model we use is very suitable. We compare the predicted values with the real values of the same period and find that the  epidemic situation in Hubei Province has basically ended after May, but the epidemic situation in the United States has become more severe after May,  so the Holt model and the ARIMA model are also very appropriate in predicting the epidemic situation in short-term.</p>\r\n<p><b>Interpretation: </b>Because the Chinese government has always put the safety of people &rsquo;s lives in the first place, when the epidemic broke out,  it decisively closed the city of Hubei Province. One side is in trouble, all sides support, they concentrate all resources of whole country to save  Hubei Province at the expense of the economy only in order to save more people. Now we can clearly see that the epidemic has been controlled in China and  the whole country is developing in a good direction. The situation in the United States, on the other hand, is also influenced by the social environment.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>ARIMA Model; COVID-19; Holt Model; Time Series Analysis; SPSS</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Since December 2019, many cases of cough, dyspnea, fatigue and fever have been reported in Wuhan, China, in a short period of time. Unexplained  cases of pneumonia with major symptoms. The Chinese health authorities and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) promptly identified  the causative agent of these cases as a novel coronavirus, and the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2009 identified the virus as the main  cause of pneumonia. On January 10, 2020, it was named COVID-19. on January 22, 2020, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China the State Council Information  Office held a press conference on pneumonia to prevent and control neo-coronavirus infections. On the same day, the Center for Disease Control and  Prevention of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China released a plan for the prevention and control of neo-coronavirus infection of pneumonia. Includes  COVID-19 epidemiological study, specimen collection and testing, follow-up and management of close contacts and information, education and training.  Risk communication with the public.</p>\r\n<p>And now in May in our country is almost under control, but in the meantime the novel coronavirus has brought the life of the people and the  development of the national economy. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause influenza as well as Middle East Respiratory  Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause influenza, as well as Middle  East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). More serious diseases such as respiratory syndrome (SARS). Novel  coronaviruses are new strains of coronaviruses that have never been found in humans before. Common signs of coronavirus infection in humans include  respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to pneumonia, severe  acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.</p>\r\n<p>Not only that, but in later cases we also found a proportion of asymptomatic infections, which is defined as the absence of relevant clinical  symptoms (e.g., self-perceived or clinically recognizable symptoms and signs such as fever, cough, sore throat, etc.), respiratory and other  specimens of coronavirus etiology (usually referred to as a nucleic acid test) or a positive serum-specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody test.  An asymptomatic infected person is not a confirmed case and therefore is not counted as a newly infected patient. announced by the NCHS on  March 4, 2020. This provision was not changed in the seventh edition. Asymptomatic infected persons actually comprise two segments of the population:  the first is those who are insidiously infected, with no or very mild symptoms. The other part of the population is in a latent phase after infection  and may develop symptoms in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Asymptomatic infections can be divided into two scenarios: first, an infected person tests positive for nucleic acid, and after a 14-day incubation  period, none of them have any Self-perceptible or clinically recognizable signs and symptoms, always in an asymptomatic state of infection; secondly,  positive nucleic acid tests in infected persons. The absence of any self-perceived or clinically recognizable signs and symptoms at the time of sampling,  but the subsequent appearance of some clinical manifestation, i.e., latent &ldquo;Asymptomatic infection&rdquo; status. Unfortunately, there is currently no specific  treatment for diseases caused by novel coronaviruses. However, many of the symptoms can be managed and therefore need to be treated according to the  patient&rsquo;s clinical condition. In addition, supportive care for infected patients may be very effective. By establishing COVID-19 spread models between  China and the United States, we can clearly see the different results of different policies and measures on the control of the epidemic. This is also  the significance of our model. Through accurate data and rational analysis, we can provide the future development trend and control strategy research  for the world in the fight against the epidemic [1].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Material and Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Data</h3>\r\n<p>The data of Hubei Province is derived from the Health Commission of Hubei Province on its official platform from 20 January, 2020. The Hubei  Province data collected in this paper includes cumulative deaths, cumulative cures and cumulative diagnoses from 20 January, 2020 to 28 April, 2020 [2].  The data of the United States comes from the domestic data platform, the Real-time Big Data Report of the Epidemic. The data collected in this paper  includes cumulative deaths, cumulative cures and cumulative number of diagnoses from 29 February, 2020 to 28 April, 2020 [3].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">The model</h3>\r\n<p>Through the collected data, we conduct a time series analysis of the novel coronavirus [4-6]. Because there is no data missing, we import the  data into SPSS, define the day as the time variable, remove the outliers, and make time series graphs. The most suitable fitting models are  automatically found by the expert modeler, which include the cumulative deaths, cumulative cures and cumulative diagnoses. The explanation of  abbreviations used in time series analysis are listed below.</p>\r\n<p>As the Table 1 shows, the ACF and the PACF are used to check whether the model is fitted. The ACF is the autocorrelation coefficient and does not  control for other variables. The partial autocorrelation coefficient PACF, on the other hand, is the autocorrelation coefficient calculated after  controlling for other variables, since it hacks out the effects of other variables. ACF is mainly used for MA model, and PACF is mainly used for AR  model. The Table 2 listed below illustrates the meaning of ACF and PACF plots in AR model, MA model, ARMA model.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">TS Model-based method for estimation in Hubei Province</h3>\r\n<p>Based on the given data of cumulative number of diagnoses in Hubei Province, we use the expert modeler to process the data and obtain the Holt  model to describe it [7, 8]. The corresponding equation set shown below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/1(11).png\" width=\"263\" height=\"79\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The related mathematical symbols used above are listed in the following Table 3.</p>\r\n<p>In order to determine that the selected Holt model can correctly describe the cumulative number of diagnoses, we use white noise for residual  test [9]. From Figure 1, the ACF and PACF graphs of the residuals can be seen that the autocorrelation coefficients and partial correlation  coefficients of all lag orders are not significantly different from 0.From Figure 2, it can also be seen that the P value obtained by the Q test  is 1, that is, we cannot reject the null hypothesis and think that the residual is a white noise sequence, so the Holt model can describe the  cumulative number of diagnoses well.</p>\r\n<p>From the analysis above, we can conclude that the Holt model can describe the cumulative number of diagnoses well. Similarly, the expert  modeler evaluates that the cumulative number of cures conforms the ARIMA (1, 2, 0) model [10]. The related equations are demonstrated followed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/2(11).png\" width=\"404\" height=\"121\" /></p>\r\n<p>The related mathematical symbols used above are listed in the following Table 4.</p>\r\n<p>The lag operator used in equation âž‹, âžŒ, indicates the difference. The Table 5 below shows the specific functions of lag operator.</p>\r\n<p>We also use white noise to test this model for residuals. As Figure 3 below shows, the ACF and PACF graphs of the residuals can be seen that  the autocorrelation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients of all lag orders are not significantly different from 0. Therefore, the  ARIMA (1, 2, 0) model can well describe the cumulative number of cured people.</p>\r\n<p>Similar to the cumulative number of people cured in Hubei Province, the cumulative number of deaths in Hubei Province also conforms to the  ARIMA (1, 2, 0) model. The corresponding equation and the related symbol meanings are the same as equation âž‹. Next, we use white noise for the  residual test. From Figure 4, the ACF and PACF graphs of the residuals can be seen that the autocorrelation coefficients and partial correlation  coefficients of all lag orders are not significantly different from 0. we can find that the ARIMA (1, 2, 0) model can also describe the cumulative  death toll well.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">TS Model-based method for estimation in the United States</h3>\r\n<p>Based on the given data of America, we use the expert modeler to process the data and we find that all of the cumulative number of diagnoses,  deaths and cures conform the ARIMA model. However, the parameters setting of each group of them are not identical. After processing, it is found  that the cumulative diagnoses in the United States applies the ARIMA (2, 2, 6) model. The corresponding equation is the same with equation âž‹. Next,  we performed a residual test on the model based on white noise. As can be seen from Figure 5, the ACF and PACF graphs of the residuals, the  autocorrelation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients of all lag orders are not significantly different from 0. From Figure 6, it  can also be seen that the P value obtained from the Q test of the residual is 0.304, that is, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, and think  that the residual is a white noise sequence.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the ARIMA (2, 2, 6) model can well describe the cumulative number of diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>The cumulative number of cures conforms ARIMA (0, 2, 0) model, which is equal to 2nd order difference equation. The related equation set is  similar to the equation âž‹. As usual, we should use white noise to perform a residual test. As the Figure 7 shows below, the ACF and PACF graphs of  the residuals can be seen that the autocorrelation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients of all lag orders are not significantly  different from 0.</p>\r\n<p>At last, we use expert modeler to process the data of cumulative deaths in U.S., then it is found that it conforms the ARIMA (0, 2, 1) model.  The related equation set still conforms with the equation âž‹. Then we perform a white noise residual test. As can be seen from Figure 8, the ACF and  PACF graphs of the residuals, the autocorrelation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients of all lag orders are not significantly  different from 0.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">The TS Model-based method results in Hubei Province</h3>\r\n<p>We set the width of the confidence interval to 95%, then use the Holt model and ARIMA model to fit and predict the cumulative number of people  diagnosed, cumulatively cured and cumulatively died in Hubei Province respectively. The obtained results shown in the following figures. As can be  seen in the Figure 9-11, the time series plots of the real and fitted data almost overlap, and the Holt and ARIMA models fit the original data well.  At the same time, after 28 April, the epidemic situation in Hubei Province has been controlled, and the cumulative number of diagnoses will basically  not increase dramatically. The Holt model and ARIMA model can also well predict the cumulative diagnoses, cumulative cures and cumulative deaths.  The Table 6 listed below contains the predicted values of cumulative number of diagnoses, cures and deaths in Day 101 to 105 by using the equation  and the Figures 9-11.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">The TS Model-based method results in the United States</h3>\r\n<p>Our analysis of the U.S. epidemic situation also set the width of the confidence interval to 95%. The results obtained by fitting and predicting  the number of cumulative diagnoses, cumulative cures and cumulative deaths using the ARIMA model are shown in the following figures. It can be seen  from Figures 12-14, the time series plots of the real and fitted data almost overlap, and the Holt and ARIMA models fit the original data well. At  the same time, after 28 April, the cumulative number of diagnoses, cumulative deaths and cumulative cures will continue to increase substantially in  the short term, which is related to the policies adopted by the US government to combat the epidemic. This shows that the ARIMA model can also predict  the cumulative diagnoses, cumulative deaths and cumulative cures. The specific predicted values of cumulative number of diagnoses, cures and deaths  in Day 61 to 65 are listed in the Table 7 below.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>At the time of the virus outbreak, everyone is living in panic, fearing for their lives and the lives of their families and the safety of the country.  We use SPSS to accurately get the models we need, such as Holt model and ARIMA model, and then use these models to fit the sequences, and estimate the  model parameters based on the sequence values [11]. Finally, we perform residual tests on the models with white noise to check whether the model is  applicable. Time series analysis of COVID-19 gives the course, direction and trend of the epidemic and predicts the likely development of future  epidemics to what state. This will give us some guidance in our lives, such as in the response to the epidemic what measures should be taken to  intervene in the development of the epidemic, to save more lives. We can see from the results that not only the epidemic situation of China and the  United States selected period is different, but also in epidemic development after 60 days or so.</p>\r\n<p>It can be seen that outbreak in the United States will continue to present an exponential growth, but the epidemic situation of Hubei province is  basically controlled, probably around 100 days in Hubei province in May outbreak was completely under control. The outcome of the epidemic is different,  which is largely related to the measures taken by the country to combat the epidemic, as can be seen from the attitude of China and the United States  towards the epidemic [12]. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to have the right understanding in the face of an epidemic, and not to be blindly arrogant and  underestimate the seriousness and potential dangers of an epidemic. Time series can not only be used in the analysis of infectious diseases, but also  in many social disciplines such as measurement and economy [13,14]. The data order and size in time series contain the information of the objective  world and its changes, and represent the dynamic process. Therefore, the main purpose of time series analysis is to understand the considered dynamic  system, predict future events, and control future events through intervention [15,17].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Limitations</h3>\r\n<p>When establishing the model, we regard the data with large fluctuations as outliers. In fact, there are many more complex models that can catch  these outliers. At the same time, when we make predictions, the ARIMA model is only suitable for short-term prediction. Over a certain period of time,  the predicted value will not change any more, due to the theory of the model. So when solving this problem, we can assume the predicted values as the  observed values, thus the long-term prediction would be possible, but the difference between the truly observed data might be larger and larger. Since  the epidemic is only predicted in the short term, it can be seen from the analysis chart of epidemic situation in the United States that the cumulative  number of people who are cured, died and diagnosed, cases are all moving in an increasing direction. However, in practice, the number of people in these  categories should reach a stable value in the end.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conflict of Interest</h3>\r\n<p>We have no conflict of interests to disclose and the manuscript has been read and approved by all named authors.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgment</h3>\r\n<p>This work was supported by the Philosophical and Social Sciences Research Project of Hubei Education Department (19Y049), and the Staring  Research Foundation for the Ph.D. of Hubei University of Technology (BSQD2019054), Hubei Province, China.</p>', '<ol>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-02/01/c_1125518723.htm\">Xinhua News Agency (2020) Responding to new coronaviruses: WHO calls for rational protection and preventive measures.</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://wjw.hubei.gov.cn/\">Health Commission of Hubei Province</a>.</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia/?city=%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD#tab1\">baidu (2020) Epidemic real-time big data report</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Xua Z (2019) Epidemiological characteristics and time series analysis of hand, foot and mouth disease in Wuzhou City from 2014 to 2018.

They remain a significant cause of maternal mortality throughout  the world [1]. Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific, multi-system disorder which is characterized by the development of hypertension (blood  pressure â‰§140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (â‰§0.3 g/d), after 20 weeks of gestation [2]. If preeclampsia is associated with convulsions, the condition  is called eclampsia [2]. In developing countries, most PE cases remain unrecognized until severe complications such as eclampsia develop. Platelets  (PLTs) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of PE [3]. Platelets are normally present in the bloodstream in an inactive state, but they can  activate instantly when they come in contact with the damaged or activated endothelial wall [4]. PLT activation begins in the first month of pregnancy  in women with risk for PE [5]. PLT count decreases by an average of 10% during the third trimester of uncomplicated pregnancy due to hemodilution [6].</p>\r\n<p>Increased consumption of PLTs causes thrombocytopenia, which is an essential sign of severe PE. Thrombocytopenia occurs in up to 50% of women  with PE [7]. PLT size correlates with platelet activity [8]. Larger PLTs are enzymatically and metabolically more active and have a higher potential  thrombotic ability as compared with smaller ones [9].</p>\r\n<p>When PLT function throughout a normal pregnancy is evaluated, the sensitivity of PLT volume was found to be significantly higher than that of  PLT count [10]. When PLTs become larger in size, this may cause changes in some PLT indices such as Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) which reflects the  average size of PLTs [11], Platelet Distribution Width (PDW) as an indicator of volume variability of PLT size [12], Mean Platelet Component (MPC)  measures mean refractive index of platelets by two angle light scatter [13], Platelet Component Distribution Width (PCDW) which measures the variation of PLT shape [13], Platelet Large Cell Ratio (PLCR)which is the percentage of PLTs that exceed the normal value of PLT volume in the total PLT count [14], and Plateletcrit (PCT) which is the volume occupied by PLTs in blood [15]. In PE, increased PLT indices may occur earlier than the development of other recognized manifestations like hypertension and proteinuria. On the other hand, lowered PLT count increased PLT indices in pregnant women during antenatal checks may be considered as a risk factor for the development of PE and eclampsia [16].</p>\r\n<p>The value of PLT indices in the diagnosis of PE is not fully understood yet. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the significance of  measurement of PLT count and platelet indices in the diagnosis of patients with PE and eclampsia.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Patients and Methods</h3>\r\n<p>The current study was a cross-sectional study carried out in a tertiary University hospital between May 2017 and October 2018. The Institutional  ethical review board approved the study protocol, and informed written consent was obtained from all participants after discussing the nature of the study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Eligible Participants</h3>\r\n<p>All pregnant patients diagnosed as PE attended the reception unit of the hospital were invited to participate in the study if they met our inclusion  criteria. We included women aged 18-40 years, with newly developed hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation. We excluded women who had chronic renal or  liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, bleeding disorders, those who use drugs have an antiplatelet effect, women with major fetal anomalies, intrauterine  fetal death, and those diagnosed with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count). We carried out a pilot study, so no  formal sample size calculation was performed. Women diagnosed to have PE according to ACOG guidelines (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists),  as the presence of (1) Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mmHg,  on two occasions at least 4 hours apart in a previously normotensive patient, OR (2) an SBP greater than or equal to 160 mmHg or a DBP greater than or  equal to 110 mmHg (in this case hypertension can be confirmed within minutes to facilities timely antihypertensive therapy). In addition to the blood  pressure criteria, proteinuria greater than or equal to 300 mg/day in a 24-hr urine collection or a urine dipstick protein of 1+ or more is required to  diagnose PE [17].</p>\r\n<p>A detailed history was taken from all women, and Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each participant. The study was carried out on sixty  women divided into three groups: group (I) women diagnosed as PE, group (II) women diagnosed as eclampsia, and group (III) age-matched normal pregnant  women as a control group. Each group included 20 women. Two ml of venous blood were collected under complete aseptic conditions into EDT Atubes for  complete blood count and blood film. Complete blood count(for patients and control subjects) was done using (ADVIA 2120 i analyzer, Bayern &ndash;Germany).</p>\r\n<p>The blood sample was analyzed within four hours after collection, and included by the following:</p>\r\n<p>- Mean platelet volume <b>MPV (fL)</b>: Analyser calculated measure of thrombocyte volume= [(plateletcrit /platelet count (&times;109/l)] &times;10<sup>5</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>- Plateletcrit <b>PCT</b> (%): Volume occupied by platelet in blood = platelet count &times; MPV / 10,000</p>\r\n<p>- Mean platelet component <b>MPC (g/dL)</b>: Measure of mean refractive index of platelet component=(mean refractive index -1.333)/(0.0018) where  1.333= refractive index of water and 0.0018 (g/dL)= average refractive index increment.</p>\r\n<p>- Mean platelet mass <b>MPM(pg)</b>: is calculated from the platelet dry mass histogram=MPC concentration x MPV x 100</p>\r\n<p>- Platelet distribution width <b>PDW</b> (%): Indicator of volume variability in platelet size =SD of platelet volume /MPV x100</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Principle ofADVIA 2120i analyzer</h3>\r\n<p>Laminar flow is induced by injecting a slow-moving sample dilution into a stream of fast-moving sheath fluid, which prevents mixing. The sheath  fluid surrounds the diluted sample and narrows it so that cells flow through the sensing zone in a single file. This is hydrodynamic focusing.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Statistical Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Data was collected and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science, version 20, IBM, and Armonk, New York). Continuous data  were expressed in the form of mean &plusmn; SD and range, while nominal data were expressed in the form of frequency and percentage. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was  used to compare the nominal data of different groups in the study, while Mann- Whitney was used to compare mean of different two groups and Kruskal  Wallis test for more than two groups supplemented with the post hoc LSD test. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for MPC,  MPV, and PCT. Based on calculations of sensitivity and specificity for cut off value of the three parameters, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each  of them was determined. The largest AUC is associated with the best parameter (marker) for PE development. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation was used to determine  the correlation between PLT indices and different continuous parameters in the study. P-value was significant if &lt; 0.05.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>The mean age of women with PE was 27.4&plusmn;6.67 years, and the mean gestational age was 33.6&plusmn;3.9 weeks while in case of women with eclampsia, the  mean age was 26.85&plusmn;5.25 years, and the mean gestational age was 32.1&plusmn;3.21 weeks (p=0.16). No statistically significant differences between the  study groups regarding age, parity, gestational age, history of hypertension, or PE and BMI (Table 1). Table 2 shows the platelet count and the  results of platelet indices in the study groups. PLT count was significantly lower in the PEgroup (mean&plusmn;SD= 207&plusmn;42 10<sup>3</sup>/ uL) than the  control group (mean&plusmn;SD=214&plusmn; 5610<sup>3</sup>/ uL) (P=0.03), and significantly lower in the eclampsia group (mean&plusmn;SD= 142&plusmn;77 10<sup>3</sup>/ uL)  than the control group (mean&plusmn;SD= 214&plusmn; 56 10<sup>3</sup>/ uL) (P=0.04). Additionally, PLT count was significantly lower in eclampsia group  (mean&plusmn;SD=142&plusmn;77 10<sup>3</sup>/ uL) than PE group (mean&plusmn;SD= 207&plusmn;42 10<sup>3</sup>/ uL) (P=0.01).</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the MPV, there was a statistically significant difference between the study groups (P=0.02). MPV was significantly higher only in the  PE group (mean&plusmn;SD=8.60&plusmn;0.95fL) than the control group (mean&plusmn;SD=7.85&plusmn;0.76fL) (P=0.02). PCT showed a statistically significant difference between the  study groups (P&lt;0.001). PCT was significantly lower in the PE group compared to eclampsia and control groups (p&lt;0.001). PDW and MPM showed no significant  differences between the study groups (P=0.30 and 0.39, respectively). Finally, the MPC showed a statistically significant difference between the  study groups (P=0.01). Additionally, it was significantly lower in the PE group than the control group (P= 0.01) and in the eclampsia group than  the control group (P= 0.03).</p>\r\n<p>ROC curve analysis of different platelet indices for diagnosis of PE and eclampsia showed that the best cut-off value of MPV for diagnosis of  PE was &gt;7.6 with 95% sensitivity and 28% specificity (AUC=0.60, P=0.02) (Figure 1A), while the best cut-off value for the diagnosis of eclampsia  was &gt;8.6 with 50% sensitivity and 72.5% specificity (AUC=0.61, P=0.01) (Figure 1B). Regarding the MPC, the best cut-off value for diagnosis of  PE and eclampsia was &lt;24.3 with 95% sensitivity and 25% specificity (AUC=0.67, P=0.02) for PE(Figure 2A), and 70% sensitivity and 67.5% specificity  (AUC=0.67, P&lt;0.001) for eclampsia (Figure 2B). Regarding PCT, the best cut-off value for diagnosis of PE was &lt;0.17 with 75% sensitivity and 55%  specificity (AUC=0.67, P=0.04) (Figure 3A), while the best cut-off value for diagnosis of eclampsia was &lt;0.15 with 70% sensitivity and 75% specificity  (AUC=0.76, P=0.02) (Figure 3B). There was no significant correlation between patients&rsquo; age and PLT indices except PCT that showed a moderately  significant positive correlation with age in patients with PE (r= 0.45, P= 0.03) (Figure 4). Additionally, PCT showed strong significant positive  correlation with PLT count (r= 0.9, P= 0.01) (Figure 5). No correlation was found between systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and BMI with all  platelet indices in patients with PE and eclampsia.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Pregnancy is associated with complex and incompletely understood changes involving the blood coagulation. Information regarding the behavior of  platelets in normal pregnancy has shown varying results [18]. PLT indices are a group of indices that are used to measure the PLT count and PLT morphology [18]. The PLTs count in the blood can be maintained in an equilibrium state by regeneration and elimination in physiological conditions [19]. Thus, either  the PLT or their morphology remains relatively constant. Under pathophysiological conditions, any factor which could inhibit PLT regeneration, increase  their activation, or accelerate their death will cause changes in both PLT count and morphology and thus results in a change in PLT indices.</p>\r\n<p>In the present study, an attempt has been made to assess the role of PLT count and PLT indices in normotensive pregnant women and also in the diagnosis  of PE and eclampsia. PLT count showed a significant decrease in patients with PE and eclampsia compared to the control group. This was consistent with  Gupta et al., 2018 study [20] that found a significant decrease in PLT count in PE patients (168&plusmn;74.2910<sup>3</sup>/uL) compared to the control group  (229.61&plusmn;73.2710<sup>3</sup>/uL) (P=0.02). Additionally, Sameer et al., 2014 [21] observed that the PLT count was significantly lower in PE (P&lt;0.01) and  eclampsia (P&lt;0.01) than the control group. Moreover, our finding of a trend of lowering of PLT count with increasing severity of pregnancy-induced  hypertension is consistent with Devi, 2012 and Bhavana et al., 2016 [22,23].</p>\r\n<p>The mean PLT count decreases during pregnancy due to endothelial stress or hemodilution. Young PLTs become bigger and more active than older ones,  and MPV level increases, especially around the 28<sup>th</sup> - 31<sup>st</sup> weeks [24]. The reduced PLT count and increased MPV values continue  throughout pregnancy [25]. Previous studies reported that the high MPV levels in patients with PE are greater than those in healthy pregnant women  without any blood pressure issues [26]. MPV has been emphasized as an inflammation marker in some diseases such as PEwhen platelet activation begins  in the first month of pregnancy in women with risk for PE; they become larger in size, which causes increased PLT indices such as MPV [27]. Several  studies on PLT count and MPV in PE reported different results. Similar to our findings, Abdel Razik, et al.,2018 reported that&nbsp;patients who developed  PE showed a significant increase in MPV than normotensive women (p &lt; 0.001) [28]. Additionally, Unlu, et al., 2014 reported that MPV values increase  in PE in contrast to normal pregnancies [24]. Dundar, et al., 2008 showed a significant relationship between MPV and PE [29]. DoÄŸan, et al., 2015  documented significantly higher MPV in preeclamptic women than the control group [30].</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, in a study by Ceyhan, et al., 2006, there was no difference in MPV levels or PLT count between PE and control groups probably  because of the differences in the methods and/or equipment used to obtain hemogram and the number of the studied cases [31]. Additionally, Yavuzcan,  et al., 2014&nbsp;observed no significant difference in the MPV between women with severe PE, healthy pregnant women, and healthy nonpregnant women [32].  Moreover, Al Sheeha et al., 2016 showed no difference in the MPV between the preeclamptic cases and the controls [16]. In the current study, PCT was  lower in women with PE than those with eclampsia and the control group with P &lt;0.001 for both. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT value after the  20<sup>th</sup> week of gestation with a cut off value &lt; 0.17% for the diagnosis of PE development were 75% and 55%, respectively. According to the  diagnosis of eclampsia development, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT with a cut off value &lt;0.15 % were 70% and 75%, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>In agreement with our results, Freitas, et al., 2013 observed lower PCT in patients with PE compared to normal pregnant women [33]. Also, Pughikumo,  et al., 2015 reported that PCT decreased predictably from the first to the second trimester; this is presumably due to increased PLT consumption and  hemodilution [34]. On the other hand, Kurtogluet, al., 2016 showed no significant difference in PCT, and they reported that PCT is the least  investigated parameter of PLT indices between normal and preeclamptic pregnancies [35]. The current study showed lower MPC in patients with PE and  eclampsia in comparison to the control group. Previous studies on diseased hypertensive patients showed lower MPC in hypertensive patients than the  normal group [36]. This was explained by the presence of P-selectin (CD62P), which is a PLT granule component of platelets that is redistributed to  the plasma membrane during platelet activation and degranulation [37]. Its expression has been shown to be inversely correlated with the MPC [38].</p>\r\n<p>Although our study showed an increase in MPV with a decrease in PCT and MPC in preeclamptic women than normal pregnant women, other markers such  as PDWshowed no significant differences between preeclamptic, eclamptic women and the control group. Our results were similar to Al Sheeha, et al.,  2016 who reported no significant difference in PDW in their study [16], and DoÄŸan, et al., 2015 who found no significant difference in PDW among  women with severe PE, mild PE, and healthy controls [30]. Nonetheless, a significantly higher level of PDW has been observed among women with PE in  the study of Freitas et al., 2013 [33] and Karateke, et al., 2015 [39]. Also, Abdel Razik et al., 2018 reported that&nbsp;patients who developed PE showed  a significant increase of PDW than normotensive women (p &lt;0.001) [28]. The discrepancy between different studies may be related to different numbers  of cases and types of hematology analyzers. The relatively small sample size can be a limitation of the present study. Large scale prospective studies  are needed from early pregnancy to evaluate the role of platelet indices in the prediction of PE. The clinical implication of the study is recommending  platelet indices estimation as a routine examination during the antenatal screening of high-risk pregnant women for PE.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>In conclusion, Increased MPV with decreased PCT and MPC are useful markers in the diagnosis of PE and eclampsia in hypertensive pregnant women.  They can be used as good predictors in those patients. On the other hand, MPM and PDW showed no role in the diagnosis of PE and eclampsia.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Funding</h3>\r\n<p>No funding received for this research.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Conflict of Interest</h3>\r\n<p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p>', '<ol>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792480/\">Phipps EA, Thadhani R, Benzing T, Karumanchi SA (2019) Pre-eclampsia: pathogenesis, novel diagnostics and therapies.

Particularly relevant to  the challenges brought about by the present Pandemic, the paper consists of three components: a theoretical basis for interspecies communication and  its power to enhance the ability to honor nature and life in a time of huge upheaval, a detailed description of the curriculum including, assignments,  dialogues attached to authentic work experienced in a carnivalesque setting and concludes with two case studies which enrich the reader&rsquo;s understanding  of how this particular curricular event affected the student teachers&rsquo; thinking about their own self-identity and its impact on their student teaching.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Curriculum Design; Animal Assisted Learning; Relationality; Teacher Training; Narrative; Case Study; Self-Identity; Pandemic; Globalization</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>There are numerous theories and philosophies competing as the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; or the &lsquo;best way&rdquo; to deal with the impact of globalization on education around the world. There are challenges on all fronts, challenges and advantages.</p>\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s Pandemic has created an even greater challenge for everyone. A deadly global threat, isolation, fear of the unknown is now a reality for all of us. Lessons learned in dealing with globalization can help us construct a powerful curriculum and pedagogy for teachers today. Students leaving home to find a new identity in a new country face the challenges of fitting in, of being able to navigate in a world basically foreign to them. Individuals facing an unknown present and future have to navigate in a new world where the invisible can kill.</p>\r\n<p>This article cites case studies from a mix of national and international students in a teacher education program before the Pandemic. It describes a method used in face to face teaching but which is equally possible in e learning. Hopefully, this will become apparent as I suggest ways to adjust the curriculum to accommodate what happens during a pandemic, when e learning and social distancing become a necessity.</p>\r\n<p>The term &lsquo;border-crossing&rsquo; has been used to describe the kinds of experiences one has when you leave an environment (job, home, country, school, and faculty) for another. It can now be used to describe life in a Pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Border-crossings occur when you place yourself in unfamiliar places or situations. Such experiences with the unfamiliar &lsquo;cultural&rsquo; characteristics of others often challenge and cause a person to adjust her cultural &ldquo;standards&rdquo; of thinking, perceiving, evaluating, and behaving. Culturally speaking, these are significant moments of enlightenment, which often happen when we visit other countries. We hope it happens when students enroll in universities &ldquo;abroad&rdquo;. Moving between life worlds is a process of educational metamorphoses. There is similar hope that such metamorphoses will occur when individuals conquer fears of illness and financial crisis and work together to help one another and keep the planet safe. The Pandemic provides opportunity for a new kind of awareness and appreciation of the other.</p>\r\n<p>The provocative feminist and philosopher, Jane Martin in her book, talks about whole person transformations which she later describes as &ldquo;culture crossings&rdquo; and speaks of the gifts that culture crossers have as being their power to circulate to their cultures of arrival and departure. This process could have the &ldquo;potential of causing cultural renewal&rdquo; [1].</p>\r\n<p>When a person or a group of people come to a new culture, they are bringing their gifts with them and the visited country is richer for it. The new country experiences new ideas, different food, interesting people, new skills, and new stories. But it isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world to do. When one moves from one place to another, it is not a simple thing such as closing one door and opening another one. There is that dark and scary hallway in between. When you are in the hallway, you become aware that you will be leaving something behind. You know what it is you are giving up. But you are not sure what is ahead. You know what you hope for, but there is uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>Self- identity has been described as a sense of continuity of self across time and space &ndash; retaining its singularity, retaining a sense of one&rsquo;s location in space, in spite of changing external and internal factors and the interaction between them. This epidemic has forced millions of humans across the planet to examine who they are and how able are they to cope with the unknown. It is our responsibility as educators to help with this coping.</p>\r\n<p>I remember my mother telling stories of businessmen in the thirties jumping from tall buildings because the picture they had in their heads of what life would be without their fortunes was so awful, they could not face it. Today there is more support for people and so far, there have been no reports of attempted suicide. We are working very hard at a new identity, a new archetype, an archetype of caring.</p>\r\n<p>An example of how quickly we can change is our present reaction to the wearing of masks. Traditionally, the mask has initiated a sense of fear, someone hiding, possibly someone who wants to rob or hurt us. Now, it signifies caring. In most cases, the mask does not protect the mask wearer. It protects the &ldquo;other&rdquo; from the virus that the person wearing the mask may unknowingly possess.</p>\r\n<p>I am feeling optimistic about our ability to reform ourselves, hopefully, as one people in the world against one common enemy, Covid 19. Leaders have long known that nothing brings a group together faster than a common enemy. Tremendous energy is put into creating a shared vision of who that enemy is. Now, no enemy is pretended for economic gain. Today there is a common enemy and our lives depend upon overcoming it and creating a safe world for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>This paper presents a practical curriculum to aid teachers and students in recognizing their personal power and to self-identify with honesty and excitement. The thing that has made transition possible for my students is that I work very hard at having students recognize that they bring themselves along with them wherever they go. And they bring stories along with them. Some of the stories are useful. Some are not. Recognizing those stories and their impact on what we do helps us to get rid of stories that limit or even harm us.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, in a change, we forget who we are. We feel we are losing ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>These are typical factors affecting identity change:</p>\r\n<p>Level of network support</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Visibility</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Prominence</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Friend location</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Homogeneous connections</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Perception of living up to some standard [2]</p>\r\n<p>It is important to think of gaining some of these factors when making a cultural move. Find friends, make connections with people who have interests similar to your own, join clubs, reading groups, be visible, avoid hiding behind the curtain of silence, and be vocal and visible through social media which suddenly has huge importance in our lives. There are also more specific opportunities instructors can invite their students to experience, more powerful, more provocative ones.</p>\r\n<p>David Whyte a writer renowned for his ability to put heart into work writes of the courage it takes to make a change and to bring yourself into your world of work. In work, it has always taken courage to follow a unique and individual path exactly, because making our own path takes us off the path, in directions, which seem profoundly unsafe. A pilgrimage into the night and the night wind. The territory through which we must travel to make a life for ourselves is always more difficult than we could first imagine; it takes us to the cliff edges of life.</p>\r\n<p>No one says it is easy. Two tools have worked well for me in helping students find voice and place in academia. Those tools are writing personal essays and animal assisted learning. Both are equally effective when used with domestic students and international students. The curriculum is the same. Both focus on real life and what is happening to us now, at this moment. What I am proposing is something [3] label as doing authenticity. Provide opportunity for authentic activity, in this case, an activity with animals, designed to allow a new vision of one to emerge through the process. What better place to start than with the horse, that ancient creature that has been such an important part of human life since we drew their picture on cave walls.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Way of the Horse</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The animal is there before me, there close to me, there in front of me-I who am following after it. It surrounds me&rdquo; [4]. It was my studies as an equine therapist that led me to incorporating animal assisted learning into a professional development program at Simon Fraser University. The relationship between animals and humans is not new. It is universal; known to all cultures, and is basically spoken in a wordless language.</p>\r\n<p>Gittins [5] in her examination of the way ancient peoples understood their relationships to animals makes a very interesting case for the significance of animals on human history. Her study of the archaeology of the People of the Upper Paleolithic and their being socially linked to animals led her to claim that humans have been so dependent on animals that &ldquo;it is difficult to say that animals could change history, could influence the outcomes of our lives now from their actions then, but I think it is at least possible to say that history would have been impossible without them&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>An interpretation of the tattoos of nonhuman animals etched upon the preserved human bodies from a Pazyrk archaeological culture of Inner Asia has led Argent [6] to suggest that to enlightened people, riding can be seen as an interspecies apprenticeship process, where both humans and horses pass along social knowledge as thoughtful actors with defined roles. From this perspective, the horse tattoos are presented as polysemic materializations of the bonds between particular Pazyryk horses and people, of blended identities, and of cosmological values related to time, memory, and belonging.</p>\r\n<p>Ancient peoples and indigenous peoples have long recognized and cherished their relationship to animals and to nature. As scientific thinking and, even more recently, technology worked to move humankind away from its awareness of its essential link to and reliance on nature, many began to lose interest in nature except to exploit it for pleasure or profit.</p>\r\n<p>Kahn, Severson &amp; Ruckert [7] claim that our interest in and attraction to nature is a fundamental, genetically based human need and uses the term &ldquo;biophilia&rdquo; coined by E.O. Wilson in 1984 to discuss this need. If we lose this relationship, we lose part of who we are.</p>\r\n<p>Rose [8] has discovered that biophilia and bio synergy (induced relationships) tend to produce different outcomes. Bonds formed through bio-synergy are likely to harmonize human/nonhuman cooperation, and lead to mutual satisfaction of human, nonhuman, and ecosystem needs. Biophilia motivates humans to bond with other animals principally for human satisfaction; this can lead to overlooking or dismissing the broader needs of the nonhuman animals and their ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p>Corning [9] suggests that synergy is more than a driving force in the evolution of life, but is a crucial factor in assuring the fate of humankind. I certainly agreed. I had personally chosen to leave the city in order to live on a farm close to the horses I had recently rescued. Research would suggest that my desire to spend my golden years in the presence of animals, surrounded by nature was a need to retain my humanity. Loyal, courageous, telepathic, loving, horses form relationships that we tend to forget about as we go about buying and selling and even rescuing them. I had a lot to learn and these magnificent creatures were willing to teach me. Critics, often of the scientific world might at one time, mocked this description, insisting that I was making up the story rather than consider the possibility of this kind of communication being a reality.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Quantum physics research during the last 20 years has discovered that physical objects are not as separate as we once thought they are. At the quantum particle level, all separateness disappears and everything is connected. SchroÌˆdinger described this process as &lsquo;entanglement&rsquo;&rdquo; [10].</p>\r\n<p>When two systems, of which we know the states by their respective representatives, enter into temporary physical interaction due to known forces between them, and when after a time of mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no longer be described in the same way as before, viz. by endowing each of them with a representative of its own. I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought. By the interaction the two representatives [the quantum states] have become entangled. [11].</p>\r\n<p>In physicist David Bohm&rsquo;s [12] concept of the implicate order, connections are possible here that transcend space and time; for Bohm, the implicate order is where entanglement occurs.</p>\r\n<p>Today knowledge of quantum mechanics has fueled so much literature on such experiences as &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; that whole journals are committed to its study. The scientific discovering that a proton could be a particle or a wave changed the way we look at the world. It is what Einstein called &ldquo;wacky&rdquo; science. As a result, scientists and laypersons are looking at the relationship of things and people and all creatures differently. &lsquo;Entanglement&rsquo; has come to be an important word in understanding how we connect in powerful unspoken ways, sharing emotions even when not touching or speaking. Those experiences we used to claim happened by chance are now seen as real and explainable.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Paul-Antoine Moreau of the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s School of Physics and Astronomy [13] unveiled the first-ever image of quantum entanglement thereby managing to capture an elegant demonstration of a fundamental property of nature, seen for the very first time in the form of an image. It is not surprising that scientists are intent upon measuring and proving the existence of entanglement. What this paper concerns itself with is creating opportunities for entanglement with animals. The science behind such connections makes it more difficult for the critic to mock thee phenomena of special communication as the &ldquo;imaginings of the person longing for connection&rdquo; for example.</p>\r\n<p>There is a second aspect of animal knowledge that could deeply influence social interaction. Kathy Pike, founder of the Mind Body Method and leader of Equine Experiential Learning describes the stories of her life experience in equine facilitated workshops in her book, Hope&hellip;From the Heart of Horses. Those stories reveal something more and more equine specialists are coming to recognize:</p>\r\n<p>Our thoughts, both conscious and unconscious, create a state of being in our bodies, and the power of being heart-centered. Since horses are finely tuned to the intentions, energy (or emotion), and thoughts that a person hides, they can reflect back to human&rsquo;s state of being and offer opportunity for learning&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Similar stories appear in the work of Mark Rashid, author of Horses Never Lie and Nature in Horsemanship. He explains the function in the brain driven by mirror neurons which permit the horse to reflect back to us the truth of what we are thinking and feeling.</p>\r\n<p>These two aspects of the horse, their ability to communicate through telepathy and their ability to reflect the real thoughts and feelings that we are consciously or unconsciously experiencing triggered the idea to use horses in teacher training. How exciting. I was finding a way of communicating more powerful than words. It didn&rsquo;t matter what language you used. It was your thought that counted when you were in the company of horses. It was who you are that matters. Today, during the Pandemic, my horses offer safe interaction for me and one by one, many of my friends and students.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Turning to the Other</h3>\r\n<p>For this part of their education as student teachers, student teachers were invited to engage with any &ldquo;other&rdquo; for one day on my animal sanctuary, Magic Horse Garden. The &ldquo;other&rdquo; consisted of four horses, twelve chickens, five llamas, six ducks, two rabbits and two goats. The relationship was not the usual one of humans using animals or controlling them. It was a dialogic relationship.</p>\r\n<p>In preparation for the day at the farm, one of my formal doctoral students, and present colleague, Dr. Charles Scott, visited our classroom and introduced the students to Rice and Burbules [14] and Burbules [15] who argued the significance of educational relationships to human and social flourishing, and developed a neo-Aristotelian model of what they call &ldquo;communicative virtues,&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;dispositions that enable communication, especially between partners who differ in terms of their linguistic styles, experiences, or beliefs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Scott focused on the need for real experience in alluding to the Aristotelian perspective out of which Burbules&rsquo; work emerges, reminding the student teachers that the &lsquo;communicative virtues&rsquo; are pragmatic-they are not learned as principles or imperatives, but arise out of our efforts to establish a way of life. Scott further developed their work in analyzing Martin Buber&rsquo;s work to discover seven dialogical virtues that form the heart of Buber&rsquo;s model of dialogical engagement.</p>\r\n<p>Student teachers in my module had studied the work of Buber and had practiced dialogic relationship as a way of commuting with secondary students. In me and you, Buber suggests we can have dialogue with nature, with other people, and with spiritual beings: &ldquo;Form&rsquo;s silent asking, man&rsquo;s loving speech, the mute proclamations of the creature, are all gates leading into the presence of the Word&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Buber [16] writes of a transformative dialogical encounter he had as a child with a dapple-grey mare:</p>\r\n<p>For me this was not merely an incidental pleasure. On the contrary there was a great, indeed an intimate and deeply moving, sense of something given. The memory of what my hand felt remains fresh, and even now, if I am to convey the sensation, I am obliged to say that what I experienced from the animal was the other, the awesome Otherness of the other, which permitted me to approach and to touch her.... As I stroked that rich mane, sometimes so wonderfully smoothly-combed and at other times so wonderfully wild, and as I sensed her vitality under my hand, it was as if I by touching her coat I was privileged to be in the presence of the essence of life itself, and placed in the most elemental relationship between Thou and Thou.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the farm experience, each student was instructed to select a creature and connect with it in some way. They were invited to be present and attentive. The farm, being a different setting from the traditional classroom in university or school, and the request to dialogue with the creature provided what Bakhtin [17] calls &ldquo;carnival&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Carnival is for Bakhtin [18] the place for working out, in a concretely sensuous, half-real and half-play acted form, a new mode of interrelationship between individuals, counter posed to the all-powerful socio-hierarchical relationships of non-carnival life.</p>\r\n<p>It was my hope that the carnivalesque setting would encourage what is often called &ldquo;a beginner&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo; A beginner&rsquo;s mind would put us all on a level playing field. This preliminary study is easily done via e-learning. And certainly, the world we presently find ourselves in forces a &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s mind&rdquo;. No one living today as lived through the Black Plague, a period in history similar to the one we face today.</p>\r\n<p>Dialogue is characterized by people who surprise themselves by what they say. They do not have all theory thoughts worked out in advance but are willing to be influenced by the conversation itself. They come with questions to which they do not yet have answers. And they do not demand answers of others [19].</p>\r\n<p>During the connection in this carnivalesque setting, students played music, feasted on roasted meats and sweet potatoes and connected with one another and the many creatures on the farm. The rather raunchy nature of carnival, of course, was omitted.</p>\r\n<p>Because students were being asked to engage with beings that do not use speech as a way of communicating, it was important that they be focused and present. Animals, especially prey animals, communicate with telepathy. Students were invited to walk silently about the farm, focusing on their breathing, to ready themselves for the engagement with the nonhumans. &ldquo;Telepathic interspecies communication may be facilitated by utilizing specific meditation techniques to quiet the mind, slow the brain waves, and shift consciousness to a level outside of time and space&rdquo; [10].</p>\r\n<p>As part of their previous work in writing, they had practiced imagery, focusing on specific intentions. &ldquo;The &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of images is the simplest kind of meaning, because images resemble what they mean, whereas words, as a rule, do not&rdquo; [20]. Animals, who do think in images, are known to tell the truth. It was my intention to prepare the students for possible communication in a new and powerful manner.</p>\r\n<p>Though students were instructed to be present in their &ldquo;turning to the other&rdquo;, they were also asked to leave their minds open to a flood of memory. I asked them to notice any memory that came to them during their experience with the farm animals. I did this in the belief that dialog with the &lsquo;other&rsquo; promotes memory. &ldquo;At any moment in the development of the dialogue there are immense, boundless masses of forgotten contextual meanings, but at certain moments of the dialogue&rsquo;s subsequent development along the way they are recalled and invigorated in renewed form (in a new context) [17].</p>\r\n<p>Toni Morrison [21] beautifully describes this process when asked how she knew the emotions of her ancestors as depicted in her novel, Sula. Morrison said she opens herself to a flooding of memory. She says it is like the Mississippi River. You damn it up, but it floods. That is because it is remembering its past and repeating the journey. So it is with writers, they remember their past and write with a flood of emotional memory. &rdquo;If writing is thinking and discovery and selection and order and meaning, it is also awe and reverence and mystery and magic&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Memory from the past comes into one&rsquo;s consciousness as implicit memory, the emotions, sensations, perceptions that come from the past.</p>\r\n<p>Siegel and Bryson discuss creating cohesive narratives by integrating implicit and explicit memories and shining the light of awareness on difficult moments from your past, thereby gaining insight into how the past is impacting your relationship with your children (and in this case, with students). They recommend bringing one&rsquo;s former experiences into the present and weave them into the larger story of your life.</p>\r\n<p>Each student was invited to write a three-page narrative of the memory that had flooded while engaging with the nonhumans. The narrative was to focus only on the memory, not the event at the farm that had prompted the memory.</p>\r\n<p>It was my belief that narrative would reveal some elemental and important aspect of identity that would influence their teaching practice, which in my mind, is all about relationship.</p>\r\n<p>Contemporary critics across the board are now, in effect, urging the adoption of a new paradigm which understands that the discourse of a reductionist approach to &ldquo;science&rdquo; has erected a false god; their growing concern with moral questions leads them to re-evaluate the methods via which we discover &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; and chief among these is a return to narrative as a fundamental activity of the human race [22]. Whether spoken or written, narrative has been championed by scholars as a means of developing awareness of self, others, and the world by particularizing one&rsquo;s physical, interpersonal, sociocultural, and historical situatedness [23-26]; thus working with one&rsquo;s own narrative is seen as a legitimate form of inquiry for university students. Narrative has been recognized as a legitimate and particularized form of scholarly inquiry with its own rigors [27-29]. Narrative has further been advocated as a means of developing reflexive educational praxis [30-32].</p>\r\n<p>Narratives, or personal essays, were sent to the professor for evaluation. The narratives were powerful and personally meaningful and deserved careful attention. They served as an opportunity to develop skill in improving writing as well as provide a level of awareness of self and one&rsquo;s way of being with others. The narratives were returned and the students met in class. Several students were invited to share their narratives. After we had enjoyed the stories as compositions and discussed ways to write effectively, we then turned to the event which had triggered the memory.</p>\r\n<p>It was a bit surprising to me that no one student had the same trigger as any other student. Each was unique. Some were very subtle. The events could not be predicted or arranged. It became clear that the process had to be natural and you had to trust it.</p>\r\n<p>The next task was to write down for private viewing what you learned about yourself from this combined event (being with the animals and writing of the memory) and the reflection of it. Students were invited to look inside to learn what this might mean to them as teachers. Would the way they were with non-human creatures represent something about how they might be with students? Would the memory that had been triggered reveal something important about them as teachers?</p>\r\n<p>Though students were not required to read their reflections, we did have a discussion. The discussion was so rich, it took several days to give ample time for all the students who wanted to share their narratives to do so at their own pace. This was not a process to be hurried. It was a time for patience and acceptance and understanding. As students were learning about themselves, they were learning about one another and developing a deeper connection to the group.</p>\r\n<p>The following week, student teachers went out into the schools for a week-long practicum. They were expected to do some observations, some one on one engagement with students and to teach a few lessons. One of the &ldquo;assignments&rdquo; student teachers were given was to journal any thoughts they had concerning their experience on the farm, their narratives, and the ideas they had about their own way of being with others.</p>\r\n<p>Upon return to the university classroom, student-teachers spent another two days sharing any behaviors that reflected how they had been on the farm and/or had been influenced by their remembered past experiences.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Case Studies</h3>\r\n<p>Several students have given me permission to share their experiences, narratives, and self -discovery as a result of the farm, the writing, the  practice teaching and the follow up reflections and discussions. A young man wrote about a time in the eighth grade when he had joined a group in  mocking a classmate from Peru who had learned to speak English by watching television and had confused the words &lsquo;constipated &lsquo;and &lsquo;anxious&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Afternoon Television and the Delicate Art of Language</h3>\r\n<p>I was raised on TV. No, not literally. I didn&rsquo;t, you know, grow up as the precocious young son on a CBC sitcom circa 1987. But you know what I mean when I say I was raised on TV, don&rsquo;t you? I bet you do. Language is funny that way, isn&rsquo;t it? We take it for granted sometimes too, language. It&rsquo;s a bit like oxygen, no? I figure that as a kid, I probably absorbed the language of TV as easily as I absorbed the English language that I had heard from every member of my family and my friends&rsquo; families and my teachers and my coaches and my corner store owners and, well, you get the idea. Communicating has always been so easy for me, and I would venture a guess that, outside of my French classes in school, I have spent exactly zero days and zero hours and zero minutes struggling to understand or be understood by others.</p>\r\n<p>My friend Pablo hasn&rsquo;t been so lucky. Pablo, like me, was raised on TV too, but the TV he was raised on was of the Spanish language variety. Pablo&rsquo;s family came to Canada from Chile during the summer that he and I were 13. I can imagine that TV probably started to get confusing for him after his arrival. All of the faces on TV, even the familiar ones he might have known from his favorite American shows like &ldquo;Family Ties&rdquo; and &ldquo;Growing Pains&rdquo; were no longer speaking Spanish, they would now be speaking English. I bet it was strange seeing Michael J. Fox use unfamiliar words in a voice that seemingly didn&rsquo;t belong to him. I wonder if people on TV seem less &lsquo;real&rsquo; and kind of puppet-like when you hear them speaking an unknown language.</p>\r\n<p>When I first met Pablo, I had no idea that his family had had some trouble with a sticky red bureaucratic substance. When they arrived in Canada, which meant that Pablo wasn&rsquo;t allowed to enroll in school for close to six months after he arrived in Vancouver. When I asked him about it recently, Pablo claimed that those six months were the best part of his first year in Canada.</p>\r\n<p>When Pablo&rsquo;s family first arrived in my neighborhood, I was excited to finally have a kid my own age living right next door. For the first part of that summer, my new neighbor and I would spend countless hours on our respective athletic training grounds that, if you are familiar with athletics, or have eyes, would recognize as nothing more than the shared covered garages of our parent&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cedar Village&rdquo; duplexes in North Vancouver. I would often see Pablo outside perfecting his soccer skills, which would then make me feel guilty about not practicing my hockey skills (if you could call them that).</p>\r\n<p>Seeing Pablo out there, tall, strong, ridiculously agile, and already growing into a man&rsquo;s frame at thirteen, inspired me to venture outside and at least make a small effort at improving my wrist shot. Or what I thought was a wrist shot anyways. Looking back, I can imagine that we were quite the pair. Pablo, taking shots on a &ldquo;net&rdquo; drawn with athletic tape onto the faux-wood aluminum siding of his home, and me, flailing away at an orange street-hockey ball with a stick whose blade had been ground down to something more akin to a battered shoe horn than any sort of useable piece of sporting equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Pablo and I maintained this routine of &lsquo;dry-land&rsquo; training for the entire summer before I, or we actually, were supposed to start grade 9. Early on, during that summer, I had tried talking to Pablo whenever I saw him in his garage or anywhere else around our housing complex, but it never got beyond one or two simple questions. As the summer wore on I gave up. It was too much work for me, trying to pull one word responses from this kid, especially when the responses were never more than a series of things like &ldquo;noh&rdquo; and &ldquo;jess.&rdquo; And besides, he looked happy enough, wordlessly banging that soccer ball off of his side of the garage wall. Who was I to trouble him with a conversation he wasn&rsquo;t going to understand?</p>\r\n<p>Little by little I stopped going outside to play with Pablo. I don&rsquo;t remember seeing him at all in August of that year, and I definitely don&rsquo;t remember talking to him until the day he showed up in one of my drama classes halfway through the school year.</p>\r\n<p>I politely nodded to Pablo when I saw him, which was something I had seen grown-ups do when meeting fellow acquaintances. Pablo returned my nod with a huge smile and a gregarious wave. He came over to me and said with a grin, &ldquo;yo, how come you don&rsquo;t play hockey any more outside your house?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. This kid could speak! Were we about to actually converse?!? And why didn&rsquo;t I play hockey outside my house anymore? I didn&rsquo;t have much time to ponder this question, or process Pablo&rsquo;s miracle of speech, because our teacher, Mr. Broughton, had just entered the room.</p>\r\n<p>Bill Broughton was, in the kindest way I can put this, Sutherland Secondary&rsquo;s requisite weirdo drama teacher. This guy looked so much like a drama teacher that it bordered on sarcasm. He had a beard and wore denim overalls with strategically and artfully placed paint splatters. He sported elaborate scarves and odd hats year round, and was fond of storming out of classes and play rehearsals in fits of demonstrative-script-throwing emotional trauma stemming from his students &ldquo;refusal to emote like real-live-actual-human-beings!&rdquo; Mr. Broughton was great.</p>\r\n<p>Even though Pablo was new to our school, he didn&rsquo;t seem to have any trouble fitting in. I was kind of jealous of him. As I said, he was tall and athletic and, well, the fourteen-year-old me would have never admitted it, but Pablo was (and still is) downright dreamy. None of those physical qualities, though, could stop Pablo from suffering through a terrible embarrassment in those first weeks at his new Canadian high school.</p>\r\n<p>As much as I was impressed with how much Pablo&rsquo;s English had improved since I had first met him, I was still a little surprised that he had wanted to take part in our school&rsquo;s Spring Break Drama Club presentation of Twelve Angry Men. For the two weeks leading up to our auditions, I rarely saw Pablo without a copy of the script in his hands. I would see him on the bus, eyes closed in deep concentration, mouthing the lines of the &lsquo;Juror number five.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>I can remember now, on the morning of the auditions, seeing Pablo clutching a script that looked less like something that was once paper and more like a wrinkled and tattered scrap of a treasure map from the prop department of a cheesy made-for-TV pirate movie. I laughed when I saw Pablo in the drama room that day. He came in full costume, a grey suit with a white shirt and a cornflower blue tie. He even wore a Twelve Angry Men-ish fedora. He must have really wanted that part. I teased Pablo about his suit. I asked him if his dad was going to notice that it was missing from his closet. I also joked about Pablo&rsquo;s script. I asked him if his mom had put it through the washing machine or something. Everyone laughed. Pablo laughed, too.</p>\r\n<p>The real laughter in the drama room that day, didn&rsquo;t take place until rehearsals were well underway. I read my part, &lsquo;Juror number 7,&rsquo; with ease. I had only started studying my lines two days before. Pablo read shortly after me, and it didn&rsquo;t go so well. He kept getting flustered and forgetting his lines. He kept getting stuck on the line that was easily confused. It went something like, &ldquo;maybe they learned something we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; But the line just wouldn&rsquo;t come out right. The angrier Pablo got, the worse his memory seemed to be. Finally, mercifully, Mr. Broughton put an end to Pablo&rsquo;s suffering. He asked him, &ldquo;Pablo, what&rsquo;s wrong? You seem to be having a hard time there, is everything alright?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m okay, but I&rsquo;m just feeling really constipated and I can&rsquo;t get these lines.&rdquo; Now, even the most respectful adults would have had a hard time stifling a laugh at this line, but in a room full of grade eighth and ninth grade students? Forget about it. People were on the floor. They were laughing in that way that actually makes your sides hurt. I laughed with them. My sides hurt. Pablo laughed too.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Broughton tried again. &ldquo;Pablo. You can&rsquo;t remember the lines because you are constipated?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Mr. Broughton, I&rsquo;m just so constipated, it makes it hard to remember everything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Again, much laughter and even some pointing. After the rehearsals, word of Pablo&rsquo;s medical condition travelled the hallways pretty quickly. Kids were calling him &ldquo;Ex-Lax&rdquo; in Gym class, and in the cafeteria, a bizarre chant of &lsquo;Pab-lo Prune Juice! Pab-lo Prune Juice!&rsquo; started when he walked in. I didn&rsquo;t join in, but I didn&rsquo;t exactly stop anyone from doing it either. Pablo wasn&rsquo;t laughing anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Many years later, over dinner with Pablo and his wife, he brought up the audition story. He said, &ldquo;do you remember that time I said I couldn&rsquo;t remember any lines for that play because I was constipated?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I said. Hoping that Pablo had forgotten, or was, at least, not going to remind me that I hadn&rsquo;t stuck up for him all those years ago.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All that time during my first year here, maybe you remember, I wasn&rsquo;t going to school. My mom and dad were at work, and I had nothing to do and no one to hang with, so I just sat in my room and watched TV all day. That&rsquo;s actually how I learned to speak English so quickly. Anyways, I would see these ads for laxatives that asked &lsquo;are you constipated?&rsquo; and they would play sad music and show people who looked totally stressed out and, like, rubbing their temples, and scrunching up their faces and stuff. So, I though, constipated had to mean stressed out, so when Broughton was like, &lsquo;Pablo, why can&rsquo;t you remember your lines?&rsquo; I thought I was telling him that I couldn&rsquo;t remember them because I was stressed out, not because I couldn&rsquo;t take a crap.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>What on the farm had triggered this memory? I was surprised when the student teacher shared that his memory had been triggered by his failure to engage. He simply was unable to find any creature on the farm willing to relate to him. His fellow student teachers were having success and he wasn&rsquo;t. He did not connect with anyone. The creatures either ran away or ignored him no matter how much he coaxed or threatened.</p>\r\n<p>I was very proud of his analysis of the situation and of his narrative. He recognized that he was demanding that the creatures meet him on his terms. He wasn&rsquo;t putting energy into seeing the world from their point of view; only from his own and his desire to &ldquo;does the task&rdquo;, rather than a real desire to engage with the &lsquo;other&rsquo;. And the &lsquo;other&rsquo; knew it and refused to play the game.</p>\r\n<p>How did this play out in the classroom during his practicum? When he went into the classroom, he had similar challenges with secondary students. When the supervising teacher left the room, the class began to take advantage of the situation and he became angry and scolded them. He realized he had lost an opportunity to create a connection; instead he scolded and they all waited in silence for the &lsquo;real teacher&rsquo; to return.</p>\r\n<p>He realized he had to put his own narrow expectations aside and enter the world of his students with a more appreciative and flexible attitude. This triggered a constructive conversation on expectations and communication with children and with animals. Students recognized that often classroom students are communicating with us in ways we do not notice or understand because they are different from us. The young man related how when Twilight, the mare, had come up to him and sniffed him, it frightened him. He thought she might want to bite him and he abruptly backed away, frightening her and he lost a chance to connect.</p>\r\n<p>Famed horseman, Rashid, says he always looks for an &ldquo;opening&rdquo;, a chance to relate to a horse, especially if the horse is difficult. The student recalled a story I had told them about a time I was doing research on using Jungian archetypes to motivate reading literature in a middle school. The students were supposed to be working on a computer program I had created to examine archetypes in art, music and literature. But a group of pre-teens at a table were pre-occupied with passing around a book. The teacher came over to the girls, rapped hard on the table, and scolded them for being off task.</p>\r\n<p>I made my way over to the table later and looked at the &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; book. It was a book of &lsquo;American Dolls&rsquo; &ndash; a recent craze amongst this age group. The dolls represented a great variety of professions and races. I thumbed through the book and the girls shared nervous glances, expecting more reproach.</p>\r\n<p>But I saw an opening. &ldquo;These dolls are really expensive,&rdquo; I ventured. They nodded that they were. One offered that her mom had bought her one for her birthday. &ldquo;Imagine how popular they&rsquo;d be if you had archetypal dolls. Archetypes are pretty universal&rdquo;. I had their interest. We began to dialogue on how the various archetypes might be represented. What would an Orphan Archetype American Doll wear? What expression might she have? If she could talk, what might she say? What adventures might she have? Which of the archetypes would they enjoy playing with? When I left the table a few minutes later, the girls were buzzing with excitement and ideas.</p>\r\n<p>I had counseled my student teachers to look for an opening. They&rsquo;ll give it to you. Did I care if they talked about archetypes looking at the program I had created? No. My objective was to introduce them to the idea of archetypes. If I could use something THEY were interested in, that spoke their language, the entire better.</p>\r\n<p>My student teacher had realized that in chasing the chickens, in moving away from the horse, in admonishing the students, he was doing everything from his point of view, his needs. He was the primary concern and missed the opportunity to engage on an equal level, a level open to who they were, what they needed, and how they might prefer to engage.</p>\r\n<p>It was a hugely important lesson for this particular student. And it was learned in so short a time &ndash; a day at the farm, a day writing a narrative, a day of reflection, a day of teaching and a second day of reflection. Some teachers take years to learn this lesson. It can&rsquo;t really be learned from a lecture, or from a book. It needs to be experienced and examined for deeper understanding. That way, the learning can be transformative.</p>\r\n<p>A second case study I was permitted to share presents a narrative of a woman from India who was flooded by the unhappy memory of being &ldquo;paraded&rdquo; as a prospective bride when she touched my elderly thoroughbred who had been brutalized in her early days as a race horse.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">The Bridal Bridle</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You may be sizing up my haunch, pal, just do not slap my ass.&rdquo; The words streaked unbidden across my mind as I walked past Xxx, my potential groom. I had to fight to keep my thoughts in check so I could keep the smile off my face. My parents&rsquo; presence in the room served as my mental bridle helping me to keep focused on my goal for the day: &ldquo;demure&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The tea tray assigned me was heavily laden with my mother&rsquo;s best tea service, white Corelle with peach flowers. I will never understand my family&rsquo;s fascination with Corelleware. Granted that it is practical and well-nigh indestructible, but it&rsquo;s certainly no Royal Doulton. The rattle of the cups and saucers seemed uncomfortably loud, forcing me to move more slowly across the silent, watchful room.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to steal a glance at my potential mother-in-law, but this proved a difficult manoeuvre to navigate while trying to maintain my demure-eyes down, definitely no eye contact. I didn&rsquo;t want her to think anything bad about me. She, however, boy, I felt her eyes boring holes through the top of my head. As though that would somehow let her read my thoughts or gaze directly into my soul. Good luck with that, lady. My act was way too good for that.</p>\r\n<p>I could sense Xxx&rsquo;s eyes on me though, carefully assessing my slow walk, maybe my looks, who know. I felt like a heifer at the auction block and was reminded of my cousin Gurdip&rsquo;s wedding when I was 15. My aunts tried really hard to get me to weave a colorful tassel which matched my fancy new salwar kameez through my braid. I might have if it hadn&rsquo;t come with a bell in the middle of it. I wanted to feel pretty, not like Bluebell the cow.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe I should have worn one that day for my own personal inside joke, but the mental image created made me more depressed than amused. And after my walk across the room, that was it. I went back to the other room, and if Xxx and his parents liked what they saw, Xxx would be along presently to talk to me in private; to continue his assessment, no doubt.</p>\r\n<p>I sat quietly at the kitchen table, waiting. Even my dog-eared copy of Pride and Prejudice couldn&rsquo;t quite get my mind off the other room. The sound of the polite chatter buzzing on the other side of the door made my chest tighten and my stomach drop inside me. I felt as if I&rsquo;d been sitting there for ages, but in truth it was only 15 minutes before a silence fell, and I heard footsteps coming down the corridor.</p>\r\n<p>One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand, I counted in my head. The footsteps paused. A voice in the hallway. Not my mother or sister, &ldquo;This door here, Auntie Ji?&rdquo; Four one-thousand, five one-thousand, six one-thousand ... and the handle turned.</p>\r\n<p>Xxx, or Balbinder, as his mother called him, stood waiting at the door. He was of middling height, dark skinned, a little soft around the middle. And he looked bored. I had dressed quite plainly that day and kept my head covered with my scarf, both at my mother&rsquo;s insistence. But despite that, I had taken some care with my appearance. Xxx looked as though he hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to tidy himself up.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; How are you? Of all the things I could have said, I came up with how are you? Great! The humor seemed to escape him though.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, I - I&rsquo;m good&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Our conversation that day was brief, and mainly one-sided. I told him all about myself, good things and bad, because I thought I should make some effort to make my mother&rsquo;s hard work pay off. You see, for her, to arm and prepare me for survival in the adult world was to train me to be a good housewife. Xxx told me he wasn&rsquo;t much of a talker, and that his parents had pressured him into coming. I did a really great job of holding on tight to my demure face that day. For the most part.</p>\r\n<p>If I am honest with myself I would say I was surprised and even offended by his words. There he sat clearly measuring me up and judging my worth with the rest of them. And I had really tried hard that day to fulfill what was required of me and to share what I could of myself. And he didn&rsquo;t want to be there? I guess I had just assumed that only a person who had a vested interest in meeting me would have shown up. Had he decided he found me wanting after all?</p>\r\n<p>The appearance of my mother with yet another cup of tea, her kind, bovine eyes full of her Bollywood-fuelled dreams of a happily ever after, did nothing to help my frame of mind. Her smile tightened the knot into my chest, which was starting to feel like panic. My smile for her was a tight grimace, my demure facade now slipping.</p>\r\n<p>Pretty soon the talking was done. Xxx stood up and cast a very appraising look over me, than went back to staring at his thumbs. That look made me feel as though I had been stripped bare. I felt the judgement of a farmer&rsquo;s stare at a cow he is considering for acquisition. And he said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Rage and humiliation boiled through me in that moment. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see?&rdquo; Really? On the auction block of matrimony I had laid bare my underbelly. Apparently only a man who didn&rsquo;t even want to be there was present. I&rsquo;m sure the look I turned on his already receding back showed that he had failed my assessment, and then some.</p>\r\n<p>As he walked away, all docility was gone. The weight fell away; the heat of my anger burned my fear and lifted me up light as air. Or at least, it lifted my right arm. I wanted to strike out and push him out the door as if he were the animal at the auctioneer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see&rdquo; infuriated me.</p>\r\n<p>My family watched me from their positions at the other end of the hallway. A moment of silence. Looks of horror. Seeing they caught me off guard and stilled my hand. Xxx knew nothing. I lowered my hand and told his receding back, &ldquo;yeah, maybe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>What incident at the farm had motivated this flood of memory? I could never have guessed. I had made available carrots and apples and crackers for students to share with the horses if they so wished. This Indo-Canadian woman had never fed a horse. She picked up a carrot and proceeded to offer it to the old race horse, Emily.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll feed the old gentle one,&rdquo; she said, adding with a nervous laugh, &ldquo;better chance of not getting bit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Actually, that&rsquo;s not true. She is more likely to bite you then Twilight, my high strung young mare would&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>I explained that Twilight was still wild and had never worn a bit. Her mouth was very sensitive, all nerves intact. She could pick a grain of sugar from your palm. You could grip a carrot and she&rsquo;d bite right up to your fingers and never touch your flesh. Lady Rhythm, on the other hand, had suffered the ravages of cruel bits. The nerves in her mouth had been severely damaged. She couldn&rsquo;t feel your fingers, and could easily mistake them for a carrot. It would be better to hold your hand flat and let her take the whole carrot from your outstretched palm.</p>\r\n<p>Thinking of Lady Rhythm as a young mare, brutalized and hurt in a way which still affected her reminded my student of a period of her life when she&rsquo;d been paraded in front of a man who wasn&rsquo;t really interested in her. Though she&rsquo;d pretended to have a lot of bravado, the whole incident was very demeaning and the pain of it still stung.</p>\r\n<p>The student teacher placed the carrot on her palm and offered it to Lady Rhythm who gently took the carrot and stayed close while she crunched the orange goodness in her strong teeth. She stayed close to the young woman for a long lingering period, as if she were feeling the memory of something that had hurt the woman and she was wanting to comfort her. I am not sure the student teacher was aware of the comfort, as I watched the old horse stay protectively close, a look of sweet compassion on her beautiful face.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What a graceful lovely horse,&rdquo; the student said to me later that day. &ldquo;I felt she was almost reading my mind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She was,&rdquo; I replied.</p>\r\n<p>How did this relate to her teaching? She recognized how complex her feelings as a young woman had been. She was caught in a tradition that she felt compelled to follow even as she rebelled against it. She felt disappointed, rejected, even by a person she did not want to be with. This recognition followed her into the classroom in two ways.</p>\r\n<p>She realized that she herself could feel rejected in a situation where she would not have expected that feeling. I had counseled the students not to take it personally if a student came late, or wasn&rsquo;t paying attention, or wasn&rsquo;t learning despite the student teacher&rsquo;s best efforts. Students are like all of us, with full complex lives and many things besides the teacher will be influencing their attention or ability to learn that day. The Indo-Canadian student teacher was aware of this intellectually, but having recalled the complex, sometimes conflicting feelings in her narrative, she was more grounded in her understanding.</p>\r\n<p>This is an important lesson, not one easily learned, especially in a young student teacher wanting so much to be accepted by students.</p>\r\n<p>The second way her experience afforded her insight was in being aware of how students caught up in an institution which is, it self, very traditional, may be rebelling against it, even as they are wanting to succeed in it. The student teacher became sensitive to the duality of emotions a teenager might feel and therefore respond in what often seemed like contradictory ways.</p>\r\n<p>For example, a rebellious student who pretends not to pay attention and who truly does not value an assignment, will, never-the-less feel defeated or hurt if not given positive feedback on the work done. The student teacher was determined not to jump to conclusions, not to look at student behavior from a narrow vantage point, and to give respect to all students, including the seemingly uninterested or those causing a disturbance.</p>\r\n<p>To listen to this student teacher speak with such clarity and sensitivity about her relationship with students was not only a pleasure, it was a deep encouragement to continue with the work we were doing combining work with non-human teachers and with narrative.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Teachers as Model Global Citizens</h3>\r\n<p>Bratanova, Loughnan &amp; Gatersleben [33] remind us that our planet is faced with tremendous moral issues around threats to our environment. Though governments are posing policies to reduce this global threat. They caution:</p>\r\n<p>The success of such measures is largely dependent on public acceptance and support [34]. This support and public participation in conservation practices rely on individuals&rsquo; motivation to protect the environment (p. 539).</p>\r\n<p>Televisions and newspapers around the world are giving us important information about the influence of air pollution on the health of people, especially during the Pandemic. We are more aware than ever of how cities with poor air pollution have more cases of deaths from the virus. Even before the coronavirus, air pollution killed seven million people a year. [35]. Pollution made the COVID -19 worse because most of the populations of the earth were already damaged by poluti8onn. Now lockdowns are cleansing the air. Will today&rsquo;s cleaner air inspire us to do better?&rdquo; How can we do better? It is up to educators to lead the way.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;How we think about and treat animals sheds light on general processes that govern human social cognition and behavior. Hence, we can learn about ourselves by studying our attitudes toward and our treatment of other species&rdquo; [36]. This premise guided my work with student teachers.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Allan Hamilton, renowned brain surgeon who uses horses in the training of medical doctors, in his description of the evolution of the super-predator says, &ldquo;We became a new kind of super-predator, an unimaginably successful killer species, playful without wits and lethal with our intellects, but, eventually no longer in touch with the secrets deep within our own hearts&rdquo; [37].</p>\r\n<p>The work we are doing at the farm is a pathway to keeping in touch with those heart secrets. Keeping in touch with heart secrets is a path to self - identity that knows no borders.</p>\r\n<p>Whyte [38] speaks eloquently of the importance of identity and belonging in a sea of change. He warns us not to get too complex or too busy that we hide from the important discipline related to personal identity.</p>\r\n<p>Writing our stories, remembering who we are, where we came from, and where we want to go happened for these students, domestic and international, in our simple day spent with animals on one small farm. It heightened awareness of us as a part of the entire world, with a responsibility to all of our plant and all of its creatures, two-footed, four-footed and feathered.</p>\r\n<p>One of the great disciplines of any human life is the discipline of memory, of remembering what is essential in the midst of our business and busyness. The human soul thrives on and finds courage from the difficult intimacies of belonging. But it is almost as if, afraid of those primary intimacies, we have unconsciously created a world so secondary, so complex, and so busy and bullied by surface forces that embroiled in those surface difficulties, we have the perfect busy excuse not to wrestle with the more essential difficulties of existence, the difficulties of finding a work and a life suited to our individual natures, the difficulties that would lead us to an older, intimate and more human sense of belonging.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MAREMP-6\">Martin J (2007) Educational metamorphoses: Philosophical reflections on identity and culture.

In the practice of transfusion medicine, the use of a defined value of hemoglobin is frequently used as an indicator  of transfusion of Packed Red Blood Cells (pRBC); however, there is no consensus among the various medical societies. As examples of this, are the  guidelines of the European Society of Anesthesiology, which suggest a Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 7.0 - 9.0 g/dL during active Trans operative  bleeding [1]. The guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) suggest an Hb concentration of 6 to 10 g/dL, depending on the clinical  state of the patient [2]. In the absence of acute myocardial or cerebrovascular ischemia, the Australian National Blood Authority recommends that  postoperative transfusion may be inappropriate for patients with an Hb level&gt; 8 g /dL. Patients should not receive a transfusion when the hemoglobin  level is &ge;10 g/dL [3]. However, these sources suggest not taking hemoglobin levels as the only factor in the decision to start an allogeneic blood  transfusion.</p>\r\n<p>The main rationale for pRBC transfusion is to increase the oxygen transport capacity, reduce morbidity and mortality, in addition to improving  the functional capacity resulting from anemia and the inadequate supply of oxygen to the tissues [4]. Allogeneic blood transfusion involves risks  such as: Transfusion-Associated Lung Damage (TRALI), hemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated sepsis, and transmission of other  infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, Treponema pallidum, prion  disease, among others [5]. Transfusion therapy and the number of units transfused have been linked to an increased risk of mortality and prolonged  stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in the hospital [6,7]. In addition to the inherent risks of blood transfusion, there are also high costs  and the supply depends on altruistic donation [8-10].</p>\r\n<p>The oxygen extraction ratio (O<sub>2</sub>ER) is the amount of consumed oxygen (VO<sub>2</sub>), as a fraction of oxygen availability (DO2); the  latter is a product of cardiac output (CO) and arterial oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>). VO<sub>2</sub> is essentially the difference between  CaO<sub>2</sub> and venous oxygen content (CvO<sub>2</sub>); CvO<sub>2</sub> is mainly determined by Hb concentration and mixed venous oxygen  saturation (vSO<sub>2</sub>), while CaO<sub>2</sub> is determined by Hb concentration and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) [11]. The  O<sub>2</sub>ER normal value is 25-30% and is used as a marker for oxygen extraction in tissue, and is expected to increase in the presence of  elevated VO<sub>2</sub> or decreased DO<sub>2</sub> [12]. To calculate O<sub>2</sub>ER, measurement of mixed venous saturation (vSO<sub>2</sub>) is  required using a pulmonary artery catheter; instead, the measurement of central venous saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) can be obtained more easily,  with less cost and risk for the patient, by means of a central venous catheter (CVC) [13]. ScvO<sub>2</sub> is reported to have a lower value than  vSO<sub>2</sub> by approximately 2% to 3%, largely due to the lower rate of oxygen extraction by the kidneys [13]. Although the absolute values differ,  the trends in ScvO<sub>2</sub> closely reflect the trends in vSO<sub>2</sub> [14,15].</p>\r\n<p>The hypothesis of this study proposes that the administration of pRBC will decrease the O<sub>2</sub>ER to a greater extent when it is found with  a value&gt; 45%. The Objective of the study is to identify whether OER &ge;45% could be used as an indication to blood transfusion in patients undergoing  pRBC&acute;s administration; which would help us determine a value from which the patient&rsquo;s clinical status benefits from the administration of the  blood product.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<p>The Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital &ldquo;Dr. Jos&eacute; Eleuterio Gonz&aacute;lez&rdquo; from the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le&oacute;n evaluated and  approved this study carried out in the period from March to October 2019, with the registration number AN18-00006. We included patients who gave their  verbal consent to participate in the study, aged 18 to 65 years and who were scheduled for elective intermediate or high risk surgical procedures  according to the updated ACC / AHA Guidelines [16] with classification ASA I to III [17], who were able to perform central venous and arterial blood  gas analysis by an anesthesiology teacher. Patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathies, ventricular septal defect and chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as sickle cell anemia and thalassemias, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, liver  failure, patients in septic status and pregnant women were excluded. Furthermore, patients who had massive bleeding [4] or any surgical procedure that  affected venous return were eliminated from the study.</p>\r\n<p>Heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, the number of packets transfused and the results of central and arterial venous blood gases  were recorded at the start of the procedure, prior to the administration of the blood product and within 15 minutes after at the end of the administration.  All blood gases were analyzed in the gas laboratory of the Clinical Pathology department, with a blood gas system using a RAPIDPoint<sup>&reg;</sup> 500 kit (Siemens  Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. 511 Benedict Avenue Tarrytown, NY 10591-5005 USA). Because there is no transfusion protocol established in our institution,  the decision to transfuse was made by the Resident of Anesthesiology in accordance with his clinical judgment and with the authorization of a professor  from the Anesthesiology Service.</p>\r\n<p>The parameters were determined based on the following calculations [18]:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; CaO<sub>2</sub>: (Hb X 1.34 X SaO<sub>2</sub>) + (arterial PO<sub>2</sub> X 0.0031)</p>\r\n<p>&bull; CvO<sub>2</sub>: (Hb X 1.34 X ScvO<sub>2</sub>) + (central venous PO<sub>2</sub> X 0.0031)</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Da-vO<sub>2</sub>: CaO<sub>2</sub> - CvO<sub>2</sub></p>\r\n<p>&bull; O<sub>2</sub>ER: (Da-vO<sub>2</sub> / CaO<sub>2</sub>) X 100</p>\r\n<p>Where CaO<sub>2</sub> refers to arterial oxygen content, Hb to hemoglobin, 1.34 is the amount of oxygen transported by hemoglobin in mL / g,  SaO<sub>2</sub> to arterial oxygen saturation, PO<sub>2</sub> to partial pressure of oxygen, 0.0031 is the solubility of oxygen in plasma at 37 áµ’C  reported in ml / mmHg, CvO<sub>2</sub> at venous oxygen content, ScvO<sub>2</sub> at central venous saturation, Da-vO<sub>2</sub> at arteriovenous  oxygen difference.</p>\r\n<p>O<sub>2</sub>ER values were calculated at the time of statistical analysis. The physicians in charge of the case were blinded to the results  obtained from the O<sub>2</sub>ER at the time of the surgical procedure.</p>\r\n<p>O2ER of 50% to 60% has been suggested as a critical value that reflects a deficit in oxygen supply [19], from 40 to 50% in the intraoperative  period and in the intensive care unit [4], for which reason we propose the value of 45% of O<sub>2</sub>ER because it is an early O<sub>2</sub> deficit  value, and it must also be taken into account that blood loss, changes in oxygen availability and consumption are usually more sudden in the  intraoperative setting. The cases were divided depending on whether they reported an O2ER &lt;45% or an O2ER &gt; 45%.</p>\r\n<p>The laboratory results were compared pre and post-transfusion between both groups with the paired student&rsquo;s T statistical test, the chi-square  test was used to compare qualitative variables and statistical significance was considered with p &lt;0.05. SPSS version 23.0 was used for Windows.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>Thirty patients scheduled for an elective surgical procedure were included, of whom 5 were eliminated due to massive bleeding and 25 patients,  14 men (56%) and 11 women (44%) were followed up (see Table 1). There were no significant differences between the clinical characteristics of the  patients and their demographics.</p>\r\n<p>Before the transfusion, 16 patients (64%) presented an O<sub>2</sub>ER &lt;45% with a mean of 26.8 + 8.06% and 9 patients (36%) reported an O2ER &gt; 45% with  a mean of 50.07 + 5.12% (see table 2 and 3). The mean Hb in pretransfusion venous blood in the O<sub>2</sub>ER group &lt;45% was 9.2 + 2.2 g/dL  (5.9 g/dL - 12.4 g/dL), while in the O<sub>2</sub>ER group&gt; 45%, it was from 8.8 + 1.7 g/dL (5.6 g / dL-13.0 g/dL); the mean of the intraoperative  bleeding was 600 ml (362-787.5 ml) and 700 ml (350-1100 ml), respectively. Patients received an average of 1.77 + 0.59 red cells units (1-3 units);  no patient was transfused with whole blood (see Table 3).</p>\r\n<p>The reported post-transfusion results showed a mean of 29.31 + 9.03% (P = 0.14) and 36.19 + 8.29% (P = 0.003) for the O2ER group &lt;45% and&gt; 45%,  respectively, evidencing a statistically significant difference for the second group. Post-venous blood transfusion Hb reported a mean of 10.2 + 1.5 g/dL,  with a minimum concentration of 8.4 g/dL and a maximum of 13.3 g/dL in the O<sub>2</sub>ER group &lt;45%, and a mean of 10.2 + 1.5 g/dl, with a minimum  concentration of 8.1 g/dL and a maximum of 11.2 g/dL in the O<sub>2</sub>ER group&gt; 45%. The difference in reported hemoglobin levels in pre and  post-transfusion venous blood was statistically significant in both groups. Hemoglobin in arterial blood is shown in Table 3.</p>\r\n<p>Another finding is the increase in ScvO<sub>2</sub> after hemotransfusion when O<sub>2</sub>ER is greater than 45% (see Table 3). Within lactate  levels in the group of patients with O<sub>2</sub>ER &lt;45%, significant changes were observed pre- and post-transfusion, but not in the group with  O<sub>2</sub>ER &gt;45%. While DavO<sub>2</sub> presented statistically significant changes before and after the transfusion in both groups (see Table 3).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>In our study we found that the level of O2ER is modified in relation to the O<sub>2</sub>ER figure prior to hemotransfusion, being more notable  when it is above 45% of O2ER. Nasser et al. found statistically significant differences between O<sub>2</sub>ER and ScvO<sub>2</sub> pre and  post-transfusion when O<sub>2</sub>ER was greater than 40% or 50% but not in the group with O<sub>2</sub>ER &lt;40% [20]. Our findings demonstrate  that incorporating the O<sub>2</sub>ER figure in decision-making to initiate hemotransfusion will decrease the need for blood components in surgical  patients. Similarly, Sehgal et al. demonstrated that using O<sub>2</sub>ER as an indicator of transfusion can potentially reduce the number of blood  transfusions; They stated that if they had used an O2ER value of 50% from their study group, only 7 of 41 patients would have been transfused [21].  The main findings of our study are compared with other similar ones in figure 1.</p>\r\n<p>During a surgical procedure, considerable blood loss can occur, which can have repercussions on the patient&rsquo;s hemodynamic state, reducing DO<sub>2</sub>,  causing hypoxia and, therefore, the need to administer pRBC [22]. It can be assumed, in a clinical situation in which we have an O<sub>2</sub>ER value  of less than 45% in the absence of organic failure, that affects any system involved in DO<sub>2</sub>, or in the face of current massive bleeding,  there will be no benefit in the administration of hemotransfusion with the aim of increasing oxygen transport to meet metabolic demands, regardless  of the hemoglobin level.</p>\r\n<p>We may be faced with a clinical situation in which we find an O<sub>2</sub>ER within normal parameters (less than 30%) and present tissue hypoxia  due to severe alteration of the capacities in oxygen extraction as it can occur in septic patients [23]. pRBC administration can increase DO<sub>2</sub>,  but would not necessarily increase VO<sub>2</sub> [24]. A current problem is the inability to prospectively identify patients who would respond to  blood transfusion with increased VO<sub>2</sub> [25]. O<sub>2</sub>ER is a marker of global oxygenation, it does not reflect the oxygen utilization  of a specific organ; therefore, it does not rule out the need for hemotransfusion at a low O<sub>2</sub>ER value.</p>\r\n<p>The present study also evidences a significant increase in ScvO<sub>2</sub> when the O<sub>2</sub>ER value is&gt; 45%. In a prospective observational  study by Vallet et al. In which the correlation between ScvO<sub>2</sub> and the recommendations of the French Society of Intensive Care Medicine  (Soci&eacute;t&eacute; De R&eacute;animation De Langue Fran&ccedil;aise, SRLF) for blood transfusion was evaluated, the utility of ScvO<sub>2</sub> as a physiological parameter  for indication of hemotransfusion was demonstrated [26].</p>\r\n<p>Using the ScvO<sub>2</sub> obtained by CVC has the advantage that its insertion is easier, has a lower cost and lower inherent risks in the  placement compared to a pulmonary artery catheter that is required for the measurement of vSO<sub>2</sub>. A study by Scheinman et al. showed that  there is a good correlation between changes in ScvO<sub>2</sub> and vSO<sub>2</sub>; however, this difference increases up to 10% in patients with  heart failure or cardiogenic shock [27].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Limitations</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiac output and core body temperature are variables that could not be documented at the time of the study since there were no tools to measure  it; they are also factors that would affect O<sub>2</sub>ER when modifying DO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub>. We will continue investigating, including  parameters that help the decision to transfuse a patient. Another limitation is the low sample size.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusions</h3>\r\n<p>We conclude based on the results that there is a significant statistical change in O<sub>2</sub>ER after pRBC administration in the intraoperative  period when a figure greater than&gt; 45% is presented. The O<sub>2</sub>ER is an additional parameter to the hemoglobin figure; it could be a guide in  the decision making to transfuse a patient. The joint use of physiological parameters should replace the arbitrary use of a defined value of hemoglobin  as an indicator of hemotransfusion; this could help us by avoiding unwanted adverse effects, promoting the optimized use of blood components and saving  in hospital costs [28]. These physiological parameters can be based on signs of global alteration (vSO<sub>2</sub>, lactate, O<sub>2</sub>ER, excess base)  and regional (ST segment alteration on electrocardiogram, near-infrared spectrometry, p300 latency on electroencephalogram) in addition to hemodynamic  parameters such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry.</p>\r\n<p>We will continue investigating for other parameters that would be useful in the decision to transfuse a patient.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Conflict of Interests</h3>\r\n<p>The authors declare that does not exist an interest conflict.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Ethical Responsibilities</h3>\r\n<p><b>Protection of People and Animals:</b> The authors declare that the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the  responsible human experimentation committee and in accordance with the World Medical Association and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>\r\n<p><b>Confidentiality of the Data:</b> The authors declare that they have followed the protocols of their workplace regarding the publication of patient data.</p>\r\n<p><b>Right to Privacy and Informed Consent:</b> The authors declare that no patient data appear in this article.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://anaesthesiology.gr/media/File/pdf/Management_of_severe_perioperative_bleeding__2.pdf\">Kozek-langenecker SA, Afshari A, Albaladejo P, Aldecoa C, Santullano A, et al.

From  early 3000 BC down to recent Qing Dynasty, great masters devoted a lot of energy on infections and epidemics. This paper attempts to give a brief  description of the historical records, followed by an exploratory study on the clinical applications of Chinese Medicine in the recent decades.  Although current epidemics of viral origin have initiated further endorsement of Chinese Medicine as treatment options, little has been said about  the preventive value. It is time to work out the immunological supportive value of the classical formulae in the expectation of developing evidence-based  preventive supplements against viral infections.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Chinese Medicine; Epidemic Diseases; Infections; Preventive Supplements</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Infectious diseases first affect the individual; then according to the causative agent&rsquo;s aggressiveness, will affect the individual&rsquo;s close circle,  then later, possibly spread to the community. Presumably, ever since human history begins, infective agents attack vulnerable individuals, commonly  presenting with symptoms of the upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal problems. The infective agent may be carried by insects or other vectors  to the nearby community and beyond, resulting in wide-spread involvements - an epidemic. This is a simple story of how the sick individual carries the  disease home and later transmits it to the community. Descriptions of Epidemics are plenty in the historical records of China. Not only are the  socio-economic-political implications well documented, but the whole processes of combat against the causative agents have created interventional  experiences of great value. Experts involved in specific epidemics have not only learned a lot throughout the process but are able to develop innovations  and new ideas related to the control of the disease. The innovations are not limited to the epidemic alone, but should have much wider implications.  Today, when the classics of the legendary Chinese Medicine Masters are studied, leading chapters of special importance are found related to episodes  of infections and epidemics.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Epidemic in China - From Ancient to Peoples&rsquo; Republic</h3>\r\n<p>Excavation of tortoise shell scriptures revealed records of disease affections that killed hundreds of people, as early as 3,000 more years ago.  This could be the earliest record of epidemics in China. The oldest classic related to medical treatment in China is &ldquo;Neijing&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Warring Period&rdquo;  (770BC - 221BC). A vivid description on infection and epidemic is given as follows:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Be aware of infections with variable but similar symptoms of different severities. They are all contagious; they need appropriate treatment otherwise  they spread. Only those in possession of anti-infection power (Qi) can effectively resist the attack and help preventing spread&rdquo;. The instructions include  advice during an epidemic: &ldquo;Within the wicked period, avoid panic, keep up with the spirit, have good physical training and choose the appropriate  treatment&rdquo; [1].</p>\r\n<p>The legendary ancient &lsquo;Saints&rsquo; of Chinese Medicine have set clear guidelines for the Management of the Individuals as well as the Community [2].  Han Dynasty (220BC - 202AD) is noted for Zhang Zhong Jiang, the great Physician and Huatoa, the physician-surgeon. Zhang develop a comprehensive system  of managing &ldquo;Febrile Illnesses due to External Invasions&rdquo; basing on Health Philosophy [3]. His great volume Book of Febrile Illnesses &ldquo;Treatise on Febrile  Diseases caused by Cold&rdquo; set the basic rules on the management of syndromes resembling infection with fever, sweating, abdominal problems and diarrhea.  Instructions included: &ldquo;check the cause; determine the main challenge; maintain a physiological balance; differentiate acute from chronic symptoms; and  persist on the maintenance of harmony&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Hautao had a wide range of expertise. With regard to syndromes of febrile illnesses resembling infection, he stressed the importance of  &ldquo;Careful scrutinisation of superficial affections in contrast to deep, internal involvements&rdquo; [4]. Great healers in the following decades include  Guhong, Wang Suhe and Tao Hungjing all three of them followed their predecessors and further developed the individual care for the infected [5].  The Tang Dynasty (618 - 907) is marked by another great physician Suen Si Miao. Suen analyzed the different descriptions in the previous generations  and matched them with different presentations of specific infections or infectionlike syndromes, concluding that &ldquo;Different herbal combinations could  be safely and effectively used for specific purposes&rdquo; [6]. The long period of early Chinese History spreading over 1,000 years has lay down the  principles of diagnosis, management and choice of herbal and other treatments of diseases. The basic principles and details are divergent but  significantly related to infections of different nature, described as &ldquo;Febrile illness&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, infections must be very common causes of ailment. Secondly, non-infectious diseases could also give symptoms of fever, cold and frailness.  Early physicians and their teachings naturally considered the different diseases with the same presenting symptoms and syndrome as belonging to the same  category. This practice did not help to delineate infection from other diseases and has tremendous influences over the subsequent era. The period of  Sung-Jin-Yuen dynasties (960 - 1368) have experienced over 100 epidemics in different regions in China. These natural disasters could have initiated  a better awareness of infectious diseases. The establishment of a unique section of Chinese Medicine related to infection: &ldquo;Wan-beng&rdquo; was the outcome.  Medical experts pointed out the unique symptom features of infection in contrast to the general syndrome of &ldquo;febrile illness&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Wan-beng&rdquo;  had seasonal attachments [7].</p>\r\n<p>Li Dang Wuen was the most influential expert of this period. He gave the details of the epidemic in year 1232, victims of which presented with  high fevers, unbearable thirst, throat swelling and pain together with upper respiratory symptoms. He invented a special formula which remains popular  to-date [8]. The establishment of the epidemic infection concept led the way to an important branch of Chinese Medicine specified &ldquo;Wa-beng&rdquo; in the  Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644) [9]. Again in year 1641 towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, a serious epidemic in Central China killed thousands of people.  Wu Juke, a distinguished physician lived within the most affected area. His &ldquo;Treaty of Epidemic&rdquo; (Wenyi Lun) was completed in this period. He emphasized  on the need for early exclusion of the causative agent, and the need to differentiate respiratory from other involvements. He observed that infections  of domestic animals could be related and yet could have different vectors of infection spread. Those were really scholastic observations of great value.</p>\r\n<p>In this period, again arising from within an epidemic era, the earliest practice of vaccination was invented. Using the nasal secretion of children  suffering from smallpox, or their worn garments to be closely applied to the uninfected people was found to result in a low grade affection causing  little harm leading to rapid recovery [10]. This primitive vaccination invented by Zhang in 1562, was well ahead of Edward Jenner&rsquo;s smallpox vaccination  in England in 1790 &ndash; 1810 [11]. Reaching the Qing Dynasty, epidemics remained frequent health challenges: 80 episodes were recorded in 228 years. The  advancing knowledge of medical pathology started to offer explanations to the origins of the epidemics, which has been described as cholera. malaria,  smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, respiratory infection and plaque. There should be good reasons for further advances in the management of epidemics in  China. Indeed, Ye Tien Shi was the most prominent contributor. He wrote the &ldquo;Treaty of Epidemics&rdquo; [12]. A more modern concept was followed with more  explanations to the sequence of events, so that &ldquo;The heat enemy first attacks the lungs before the heart. Later, other internal organs will be the  targets. Treatment requires a clear judgement on the stages of disease progress, from the gradual commencement towards the advanced un-redeemable&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Another influential figure Wu Ju Tong who lived through the early stage of Modern Medicine (1758 - 1836) applied Ye&rsquo;s recommendations during the  Central China epidemic of 1793 and was well known for the enlightening wisdom. He was able to simplify the management of complicated upper respiratory  infectious diseases into three practical stages: &ldquo;Firstly, the lung and heart; thence, the stomach and spleen; lastly, the intestines, liver  and kidneys&rdquo; [13].  It might be true to say that Traditional Chinese Medicine grew and matured with epidemics. The continuous development of Infection Concepts and  Treatment principles: from ancient times to before the Republic of China has given us a clear picture of the medical advancement with time, which  was not only related to infections and epidemics alone but had reflected the overall picture of Chinese Medicine throughout history. The closeknitted  relationship between the infection symptoms and other disease presentations has influenced a joint development involving both. Yet the gradual separation  of the two streams started in the Qing Dynasty (1636 - 1911). Separate developments of the two streams would need to be considered together with the  speedy introduction of Modern Medicine to China.</p>\r\n<p>Reaching the period of the National Republic (since 1911), the biological science based modern medicine was brought to China by the missionaries  from Europe and America. Hospitals were built and hospital practice with the introduction of new diagnostic principles and techniques, together with  target orientated pharmaceuticals provided new options for disease treatment and great challenges to traditional practices. The shift from traditional  to modern had been a very gradual process very much supported by the upper class intellectuals while traditional practice remained popular under normal  circumstances. Given its quick responses, modern infection management should be preferred by all people on the individual level. However, when facing  an epidemic, difficulties and insufficiencies are met, and unfavorable gaps in the management would become obvious. With the strong cultural heritage  of Traditional Chinese Medicine, popular traditional practices to combat infection would nationally come up for rescue [14].</p>\r\n<p>Since 1911, 7 epidemics of influenza infection occurred in China: 4 of which (1918, 1957, 1968, 1977) affected China and other countries, while  3 others affected China alone (1997, 1999 and 2003). The 1918 pandemic was the most damaging epidemic ever reported of the influenza virus. China  apparently was not as severely hit and the mortality was lower. One reason given was that modern medicine was not well developed, no vaccine was  available but Chinese Medicine contributed a lot to the control of the infection [15]. Since 1949, during the influenza epidemics in China, strong  national encouragements for the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine at different stages of the disease were observed. Since influenza has a universal  (global) low rate of mortality, the value of Chinese Medicine presumably could be related to symptom control and prevention of complications [16].  Mild cases could be receiving herbal treatment alone, moderately severe cases could be supplemented with modern therapy while severe cases with  respiratory complications would be hospitalized [17].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Traditional Chinese Medicine and Coronal Virus Epidemics</h3>\r\n<p>We have seen how epidemics in ancient China have enriched the management of the infections and the control of their spread ever since 3,000 years ago.  In the most recent influenza epidemics, amidst fear and concern of disease contraction, Chinese people resorted to traditional medicine, voluntarily and  very much acted according to the National Policy. Are there other innovative ways to better use the popular traditional practice for the need of infection  control? Pharmacologists would not consider herbal formulations suitable for drug development [18, 19]. The use of Herbal medicine formulations in the  treatment of infections has no simple target orientation. Instead they aim to provide the maintenance of a physiologically balanced state i.e. when  &ldquo;Yin and Yang&rdquo; exist in harmony. In modern terms it might mean an immunological harmony that would not allow disturbances from an outside invader.  This effect could be considered a situation resembling a post vaccination immunological state of defence [20].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Can Herbal Formulations Induce Better Immunological Defense?</h3>\r\n<p>This could be the challenge for Traditional Chinese Medicine experts. One of the most important teachings on Chinese Medicine given in Neijing  is &ldquo;Treat the undiseased&rdquo;. This concept emphasises the individual&rsquo;s responsibility to fight against disease.  It should also carry the message of  Prevention against infection. However, a careful study of the rich collection of herbal formulae advocated for infections and epidemics fail to  reveal specific categories advocated for &ldquo;Preventive use&rdquo;. Nevertheless, if treatment were given at an early stage, the purpose could relate to  the prevention of deterioration. Since the individual is responsible for his/her own health, when facing the challenge of infection, early treatment  is the next move when prevention fails. Whatever is the background behind the absence of Preventive specification among formulations advocated  for epidemics, those recommended for early treatment of mild clinical presentations could be considered as appropriate for Prevention [21].  Prevention is particularly important for patient care-givers in the family circle and clinical settings.</p>\r\n<p>During the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003, a clinical trial using herbal medicine for prevention was conducted. Details of the trial  is given as follows:</p>\r\n<p>As a means to protect the at-risk hospital workers, an innovative herbal formula was created and given to 3,160 of them for two weeks&rsquo; consumption.  During the two weeks, infection symptoms and adverse effects were closely monitored. The herbal formula was the combination of two classical formulae  popular for the treatment of cold and influenza like infections. One month later, it was shown that none of the herbal consumers contracted the  infection whereas 0.4% of the non-consumer controls were infected [22]. The immunological states of 37 of the herbal consumers were studied  serologically before and after the herbal consumption. Boosting of the innate immunological state of the consumers was confirmed, and the adverse  effects were found to be insignificant [23].</p>\r\n<p>Follow-up, immunological studies on the same formula have given further evidences of its immunological boosting effects [24, 20]. In any epidemic  of respiratory disease, it is not easy to organize proper clinical trials. The Hong Kong study during the SARS crisis in 2003 succeeded in giving early  objective indications that classical anti-febrile illness herbal formulae could be useful in an epidemic to provide personal protection against the  contraction of the highly contagious disease. Further research would be very much needed. After the SARS crisis, since 2005 some Chinese Medicine  experts in China have carried out clinical trials using herbal formulations for preventive purposes. The target populations included medical staff;  people in close contact and students. Four such reports are available. Unfortunately, they are of very poor qualities: reports were short, client  numbers varied from over 10,000 to just a few; and only general impressions like &ldquo;lower infection rates&rdquo; were given [25].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>This paper was prepared during the Pandemic of COVID-19. China once more, has been advocating the use of Chinese Medicine for the treatment of the  infection on a national level, and has proposed many optional choices of herbal formulae. Once more the treatment and prevention aspects are vaguely  defined. Now that genuine explorations on the immunological protection of the at-risk groups have started, it is very much wished that further research  commitments could be made on the creation of evidencebased supplements for the boosting of innate immunological defense abilities, since an effective  vaccine is yet to be expected [26].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Conflict of Interest</h3>\r\n<p>The authors state no conflict of interest.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Funding Source</h3>\r\n<p>This work was supported by the State Key Laboratory Fund provided by the Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Ethical Approval</h3>\r\n<p>No needed.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>Huangdi Neijing; Yellow Emperor\'s Internal Classic.</li>\r\n    <li>Shennong\'s Herbal Classic; Shennong Materia Medica.</li>\r\n    <li>Zhang Zhong Jing (1986) Treatise on Febrile Disease Caused By Cold; Shanghan Lun; Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases.</li>\r\n    <li>Hua Tuo&rsquo;s.

The lifetime incidence of UTI in women is 50% to 60%. Recurrent UTI is also common, occurring in 14% to 27% of UTI patients [1, 3, 4]. Initial treatment failure, resulting in recurrent UTI, may occur for various reasons: UTI may be complicated, as in pyelonephritis; patients may not comply with treatment; the diagnosis may be incorrect; and antibiotic resistance may not have been recognized [5, 6]. Accumulating evidence has established that Standard Urine Culture (SUC) may not detect clinically significant bacteria [7]. Reliance on urine culture lead us to believe that urine is sterile. On the other hand, application of molecular methods such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) have demonstrated that urine is not sterile, even in healthy people [7, 8]. The study described herein was conducted to compare the performance of Multiplex PCR-Based Molecular Testing (M-PCR) with that of SUC for diagnosis of UTI in symptomatic patients.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Selection and Description of Participants</h3>\r\n<p>Study participants were patients who presented with symptoms of UTI at urology clinics. Patients with no symptoms of UTI were not included. Patients were evaluated by any of 75 physicians from 37 urology offices in seven states. A total of 2511 consecutive patients were enrolled between July 26, 2018 and February 27, 2019. All patients provided written informed consent per forms approved by the Western IRB (20181661). Inclusion criteria included patients &ge; 60 years of age presenting with symptoms of acute cystitis, complicated UTI, persistent UTI, recurrent UTIs, prostatitis, and pyelonephritis, and patients at any age presenting with a history and symptoms of interstitial cystitis.</p>\r\n<p>Exclusion criteria included prior participation in this study, antibiotics use for any reason other than UTI at the time of enrollment, presence of chronic (&ge; 10 days) indwelling catheters, and self-catheterization. Patients with urinary diversion were excluded from the study. Patients without documented specimen collection and stabilization time, or sufficient specimen volumes to perform both urine culture and the M-PCR test coupled with Pooled Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing (P-AST) were also excluded from the study. Results from the P-AST are discussed in a separate manuscript.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Urine Culture</h3>\r\n<p>Urine culture in the study was performed following SUC procedures. Urine samples were obtained from patients by either self-administered clean catch or catheterization. Samples were collected and transported to Pathnostics (Irvine, California) for testing by culture. For culture, urine was vortexed and a sterile plastic loop (1 &micro;L) was used to inoculate blood agar plates. A sterile plastic loop (1 &micro;L) was used also to inoculate Colistin and Nalidixic Acid Agar/Macconkey Agar (CNA/MAC) plates, one loop-full of urine on the CNA side of the plate and another full loop-full on the MAC side of the plate. All plates were incubated at 35&ordm; C in 5% CO2 for &ge;18 hours and then examined for evidence of growth. Per CLSI Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (30<sup>th</sup> Edition), plates with &lt; 104 CFU/ml were reported as normal urogenital flora.</p>\r\n<p>For plates with growth (&ge; 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml), the quantity and morphology of each organism was recorded. The maximum readable colony count using the 1 &micro;L loop is &gt; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml. Colony counts were performed on blood agar plates. Species identification and colony counts were performed on CNA/MAC plates. For plates with &le; 2 pathogens, species identification and colony counts were reported for each pathogen with &ge; 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml. If &ge; 3 pathogens were present, and one or two were predominant, species identification and colony counts were reported. If &ge; 3 pathogens were present without predominant species, a mixed morphotype was reported. Pathogen identification was confirmed with the VITEK 2 Compact System (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) in accordance with standard operating procedures.</p>\r\n<p>Briefly, a sterile swab was used to transfer morphologically similar colonies from positive blood agar plates to prepared polystyrene test tubes containing 3.0 mL of sterile saline. The sample was adjusted for density (equivalent to McFarland No. 0.50 to 0.63). The sample tube and an appropriate identification card were placed into the cassette and inserted into the VITEK 2 instrument. The identity of the bacteria was used to determine Gram status, and a GN card was used for Gram-negative bacteria, and a GP card was used for Gram-positive bacteria. A YST card was used for yeast. Pathogen identification was read from the VITEK 2 instrument.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">DNA extraction and M-PCR analysis</h3>\r\n<p>DNA was extracted from urine samples with the KingFisher/ MagMAX Automated DNA Extraction instrument and the MagMAX DNA Multi-Sample Ultra Kit (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 400&micro;L of urine were transferred to wells in 96- well deep-well plates, sealed, and centrifuged to concentrate the samples; supernatant was removed. Enzyme Lysis Mix (220&micro;L/ well) was added and incubated for 20 min at 65&ordm;C. Proteinase K Mix was added (50&micro;L/well) and incubated for 30 min at 65&ordm;C. Lysis buffer (125 &micro;L/well) and DNA Binding Bead Mix (40 &micro;L/ well) were added, and the samples shaken for a minimum of 5 min. The 96-well plate was loaded into the KingFisher/MagMAX Automated DNA Extraction instrument, which was operated in accordance with standard operating procedures.</p>\r\n<p>DNA samples were analyzed with the Pathnostics Guidance<sup>&reg;</sup> UTI Test. The samples were mixed with universal PCR master mix and amplified with TaqMan technology on a Life Technologies 12K Flex Open Array System. DNA samples were spotted in duplicate on 112-format Open Array chips. Plasmids for each organism being tested for were used as positive controls. Candida tropicalis was used as an inhibition control. A data analysis tool developed by Pathnostics was used to sort data, assess the quality of data, summarize control sample data, identify positive assays, calculate concentrations, and generate draft reports. Probes and primers were used for the following 23 bacteria and 2 bacteria groups:</p>\r\n<p><b>Bacteria:</b> <em>Acinetobacter baumannii, Actinotignum schaalii, Aerococcus urinae, Alloscardovia omnicolens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Corynebacterium riegelii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Pantoea agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>.</p>\r\n<p><b>Bacterial groups:</b> <em>Coagulase Negative Staphylococci Group (CoNS), including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunesis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em>, and Viridans Group <em>Streptococci</em> (VGS), <em>including Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus pasteuranus</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The quantities of each of the bacterial species were determined using the standard curve method: first, standard curves of each of the bacterial species were generated from testing replicates of dilution series of known concentrations of the bacterium; constants necessary for the quantitation of each of the bacterial species in unknown samples, such as slope and intercept, were established from each of the standard curves; then PCR Ct values of a target bacterial species from an unknown sample were compared to the standard curve, and the concentration of the target bacterial species (cells/mL) present in the samples was extrapolate and determined. Bacterium with quantity of &ge;10,000 cells/mL was defined as &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;detected&rdquo;, and bacteria with quantity &lt; 10,000 cells/mL was defined as &ldquo;negative&rdquo; or &ldquo;not detected&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Statistics</h3>\r\n<p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data in the study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Patient Demographics and Clinical Information</h3>\r\n<p>Patient demographics and clinical information are given in Table 1. Of the 2511 participants, 1360 (54%) were females and 1151 (46%) were males. The median age in this study was 73 and the range was 24-100 years, with 99% of patients over the age of 60. All patients were presented with symptoms of UTI, such as dysuria, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, pain or pelvic discomfort, fever, and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). Positive urine  analysis, defined as the presence of blood, leukocytes or nitrites, was present in 75.5% of the study population. Antibiotic usages in the last 3 weeks were seen in 16.9% of female and 5.7% of male patients (Table 1).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">M-PCR identified more UTI-symptomatic patients with bacteria in their urine than SUC</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, M-PCR detected bacteria in 62.7% (1575) whereas SUC detected bacteria in 43.7% (1098) of the 2511 patients. SUC and M-PCR were both positive in 1018/2511 (40.5%) cases and were both negative in 856/2511 (34.1%) cases. Only 80 out of the 2511 (3.2%) cases were positive in SUC but negative in M-PCR. On the contrary, 557 out of the 2511 cases (22.2%) were positive in M-PCR but negative in SUC (Table 2). M-PCR detected more bacteria species, especially Gram-positive species, in  UTIsymptomatic patients than SUC. The M-PCR panel in this study tested for 23 bacteria plus two bacterial groups. It detected 24 different bacteria or groups in the 2511 patients in the study, and SUC detected 21.</p>\r\n<p>Among the 21 bacteria detected by SUC, 18 were also detected by M-PCR, with higher detection rates by M-PCR than  SUC for almost all of them, especially for the Gram-positive species. For example, <em>E. faecalis</em>, CoNS, VGS, and <em>A. urinae</em>, were detected in 200 (8%), 72 (2.9%), 49 (2%), and 21 (0.8%) in the 2511 patients by SUC, and were 253 (10.1%), 309 (12/3%), 439 (17.5%), and 460 (18.3%) by M-PCR (Figure 1). <em>E. coli</em> was the most detected bacterium by both SUC and M-PCR, with detection rates of 21.2% and 22.7%, respectively. The top bacterial species detected by SUC, defined as at least a 1% detection rate) included 8 bacterial species, where M-PCR detected 13 bacteria with at least a 1% detection rate, including all 8 that were detected by SUC (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<p>Among the 24 bacteria detected by M-PCR, SUC failed to detect 6 of them, including five Gram-positive bacteria (<em>A. schaalii, A. omnicolens, C. riegelii, M. genitalium, and M. hominis</em>), and one Gram-negative bacterium, <em>U. urealyticum</em>. Four of the 6 were on the top list detected by M-PCR (Figure 1). A total of 590 patients (23.5%) were detected by M-PCR to have at least 1 of the 6 bacteria species in their urine samples. There were 3 bacterial species detected by SUC that were not detected by the M-PCR. They were the <em>Enterobacter</em> species, the <em>Enterococcus</em> species, and the other species, detected in only 0.9%, 0.2% and 0.9%, of all patients, respectively. This is not due to the failure of the M-PCR methods, but rather that the M-PCR panel did not include primers and probes for the three bacteria (Figure 1). Bacteria detected by SUC or M-PCR in male and female patients were detailed in (Supplementary Table 1).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">M-PCR detected more polymicrobial infections in UTIsymptomatic patients than SUC</h3>\r\n<p>In this study, SUC was found to have limited capacity to detect polymicrobial infections compared with M-PCR (Table 3). The specific bacteria identified in polymicrobial infections are listed in Figure 2. Eight hundred sixty-one polymicrobial infections were detected by M-PCR and SUC combined. Among these detections, M-PCR detected 834 of 860 (96.9%), SUC detected 168 of 860 (19.5%) and 141 of 860 (16.4%) were polymicrobial by both M-PCR and SUC. Polymicrobial infections were detected in 34.3% (861/2511) of patients, 53.0% of M-PCR positives (834/1575) but only 15.3% of SUC positives (167/1098) (Table 3).</p>\r\n<p>One of the six bacteria that were detected by M-PCR but not by SUC, <em>A. schaalii</em>, was the most common bacterium involved in polymicrobial infections and was involved in 53.0% (442/834) of all polymicrobial detections by M-PCR. The total cases detected with <em>E. coli</em> were similar between SUC and M-PCR. However, SUC reported that <em>E. coli</em> was most commonly a monomicrobial infection where M-PCR reported <em>E. coli</em> most commonly as a polymicrobial infection. Similar results were observed in other bacteria species, such as <em>E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae</em>, and CoNS (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table 2).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>This prospective study of over 2500 patients with symptoms of UTI  found that M-PCR was positive for bacteria in 62.7%  of patients versus 43.7% with SUC. Twenty-two percent of PCR-positive  patients had a negative urine culture and PCR detected  five times more polymicrobial infections than did urine culture (834 vs. 167). These results are consistent with previous studies that have also shown that PCR provides advantages in detection sensitivity and identification specificity for the diagnosis of UTI [9-11]. PCR is expanding our understanding of the urobiome and alterations with infection and disease. SUC has a limited ability of to grow fastidious organisms, especially Gram-positive bacteria. As a result, PCR reports more bacteria, more different bacteria and more bacterial combinations. Others have demonstrated the poor performance of SUC.</p>\r\n<p>Hilt showed that in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients 92% had negative SUC, yet 80% of these were positive when using expanded quantitative urine culture techniques to improve growth of fastidious organisms [8]. Khasriya showed that culture of the shed urothelial cells (where uropathogens adhere) resulted in large numbers or bacteria that were undetected on SUC [12]. Kline reported that Gram-positive bacteria including Aerococcus, <em>Actinobaculum</em> and <em>Corynebacterium</em>, have been overlooked as uropathogens because of the limitations of the SUC [13]. In this study, six bacteria detected by M-PCR were not detected by culture and five of them were Gram-positive. Three of these bacteria (<em>A. schaalii, A. omnicolens, and C. riegelii</em>) were among the 10 most frequently detected bacteria by M-PCR, combining for 22.3% of all bacterial detections.</p>\r\n<p>Even more, <em>A. schaalii</em> was found in polymicrobial infections more often than any other bacterium: it was involved in 53.0% (442/834) of all M-PCR detected polymicrobial infections. Five of the six have also been reported as pathogenic for UTI and associated with increased risk for sepsis and bacteremia, endocarditis, Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene, and abdominal abscess [14-16]. Of the others, <em>A. schaalii</em> and <em>A. omnicolens</em> are acknowledged as uropathogens [17,18]. <em>C. riegelii</em> is commonly regarded as a commensal but has also been shown to cause UTI [19,20]. In addition, both <em>M. hominis</em> and <em>U. urealyticum</em> have been documented as causing LUTS, and may be antibiotic resistant [21,22]. Therefore, one cannot say that the organisms identified by PCR are not pathogenic, instead, that we do not yet understand their role in the normal urobiome or in a urinary tract infection.</p>\r\n<p>Studies like these are among the first to investigate these patients with both SUC and PCR and further work is ongoing. The M-PCR method detected five times as many polymicrobial UTI&rsquo;s than traditional culture. SUC is inherently limited in its ability to detect and identify pathogens in polymicrobial infections [23, 24]. The proportion of the total number of patients with M-PCR detected polymicrobial infections in this study was 33.2%, which is consistent with previous reports [7, 8]. Importantly, among patients who tested positive for bacteria with M-PCR, there were more polymicrobial infections (53.0%, 834/1575) than monomicrobial infections (47.0%, 741/1575). The study of urine bacteria by PCR in the patient with UTI symptoms will help us identify the abnormalities of the urobiome.</p>\r\n<p>The large number of Gram-positive organisms in the urine  identified in this and other studies may indicate an important role in the normal urobiome and in the pathogenesis of polymicrobial UTI, perhaps a critical role in the development of consortia, non-random communities of microbes that interact synergistically in providing community members with growth and survival advantages. Failure of standard culture to detect and identify bacteria also raises the possibility of treatment failure due to unidentified antibiotic resistance. Several papers have reported that clinical antibiotic resistance, i.e., antibiotic response in the patient, was different from resistance predicted on the basis of results of laboratory tests [25, 26]. This difference could occur for a number of reasons, but failure to grow bacteria will lead to failures of sensitivity testing.</p>\r\n<p>Our data showed that the M-PCR/P-AST test takes an average of 29.7 hours (9 hours less than SUC) to provide physicians with urine pathogen and drug sensitivity results. This difference is increase to a median of 19 hours (34.5 hours and 53.7 hours, for M-PCR/P-AST and SUC, respectively) for patients for both positive pathogen identification and susceptibility results. The faster turnaround time also places M-PCR in an advantageous position, compared to SUC.</p>\r\n<p>The current study was not designed to test the clinical advantage of M-PCR over SUC. All bacteria on the PCR panel and all bacteria detected in SUC have previously been described as causing UTI [7,8]. However, all bacteria do not contribute equally to pathogenesis. This is especially true for polymicrobial infections. Some bacteria may be more pathogenic than others, and interactions among bacteria in polymicrobial infections have yet to be described.</p>\r\n<p>The identification of more and different bacteria in urine from patients with UTI by PCR does not prove the bacteria are the cause of the patients&rsquo; symptoms. Proof of this relationship will depend on documenting that eradication of the putative pathogens results in resolution or improvement of symptoms. The detection criterion of &ge;10,000 cells/mL for M-PCR was also noteworthy.</p>\r\n<p>The threshold of &ge;10,000 cells/mL was selected to be consistent with the current standard of care. Studies have shown that colony counts as low as 10<sup>2</sup> bacteria/mL are clinically significant [27]. Others have argued that reducing the threshold will ensure physicians do not miss true cases of UTI&rsquo;s and that patients will be treated properly [28,29]. The caveat is that patients must be symptomatic of a UTI as it is demonstrated that the bladder contains a microbiome [7,8,27,29].</p>\r\n<p>In addition to bacteria, we examined the fungus and virus detection in symptomatic patient urine samples. There were several cases for which yeast and viral particles were identified in combination with bacteria. Likewise, there were cases for which the fungus and virus were found independent of bacteria. These microbes may also be pathogenic. While this paper focuses on comparing bacteria in culture versus M-PCR, other articles will focus on fungal and virus detection.</p>\r\n<p>Strengths of this study include the large number of  symptomatic patients recruited from 37 different urology clinics in seven states, all serving in a community setting. The patients participating in the study likely reflect the larger population of UTI patients, to evaluate the performance of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PCR. These results should be relevant to clinicians attending to patients who present with UTI symptoms. The results of this prospective study of over 2500 patients with symptoms of urinary tract infection demonstrated the greater ability of M-PCR to detect bacteria over SUC, especially for detection of Grampositive  organisms and polymicrobial infections. Use of M-PCR  for evaluation of urinary tract infections might improve detection of pathogenic bacteria and consideration of antibiotic resistance and susceptibility. These advantages, in turn, might lead to more effective treatment [30-33].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgment</h3>\r\n<p>All funding was provided by Pathnostics and Thermo Fisher</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Conflicts of Interest</h3>\r\n<p>David Baunoch and Natalie Luke are employees of Pathnostics, Inc.

Breast milk has protective and immunological properties that prepare babies immediately after birth and well into adulthood [4]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [5], the World Health Organization (WHO) [6], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [7] and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) [8], recommend mothers breastfeed exclusively for at least six months and continue breastfeeding, complemented with solid foods for a minimum of  one to two years to reap the full benefits of breastfeeding [5,9,10]. Breastfeeding reduces the risks of ovarian and breast cancer, type II diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular disease [5,11]. Mothers who breastfeed realize an earlier return of the uterus to normal size, decreased postpartum bleeding, regressed uterine fibroids [12], decreased rates of depression [5,12-14], and some evidence suggests increased bonding with their babies [15,16]. Breastfeeding is cost-effective compared to formula feeding, and provides health-related savings to Medicaid [17-20]. Exclusive breastfeeding provides benefits even if babies are fed for a few days [5,21]. Hence, it is critical that healthcare professionals promote and support continued breastfeeding as a natural choice of nutrition for infants [22,23].</p>\r\n<p>Significant evidence has shown that breastfeeding is challenging for women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy [24-27]. Women with prepregnancy body mass index (BMI&ge;25 are more likely to terminate breastfeeding practices earlier than women with normal BMI in the United States, Europe, and Australia [24-33]. The WHO (1995) [34], defines excess weight gain, or maternal obesity, as maternal prepregnancy BMI (derived by formula from prepregnancy weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m&sup2;). Overweight is defined as a BM&ge;25, and obese, as BMI&ge;30 [34-36]. Multiple studies have concluded that a dose-response relationship exists between prepregnancy BMI and breastfeeding outcomes [23-26], Hilson et al. [33], concluded overweight and obese women were more likely to terminate breastfeeding within the first week and less likely to be breastfeeding at discharge (OR 3.63, p&lt;0.01; OR 3.12, p&lt;0.01). Approximately 18% of overweight women and 37% of obese women stopped breastfeeding 14-60 days postpartum, after adjusting for known covariates such as parity, length of gestation, birth weight, mother&rsquo;s age, and highest-grade level attained in this study [32,33]. Further, increasing obesity categories appear to progressively intensify breastfeeding cessation from weeks one through twenty, based on WHO classification: Class I (30-34.9), II (35-39.9), and III ( 40) [30,32,37,38].</p>\r\n<p>The results of most of the studies concerning prepregnancy overweight/obesity and breastfeeding cessation were not generalizable to all races/ethnicities and socioeconomic status because the populations studied were mostly White, of high socioeconomic status, and geographically spread out across urban and rural areas. Studies of prepregnancy BMI have had mixed results by race and ethnicity [28,39-42]. While obese Hispanic women were linked to early termination of breastfeeding, no association was found among Blacks [42], even where stratified by income [43]. Kitsantas et al. [43], showed the odds of not breastfeeding past two and four months were highest for  lowincome overweight and obese Black women, compared to women  of higher socioeconomic levels. Approximately 20% of lowincome  women stopped breastfeeding within 4 weeks [43,44].  While findings suggest that medical complications contribute to early breastfeeding termination among women with high prepregnancy BMI, Kitsantas &amp; Pawloski [45], found overweight/ obese women without medical complications, notwithstanding, carried an 11% increased risk of early termination compared to normal BMI.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the literature shows that breastfeeding termination among overweight and obese women are multi-factorial, and include biological factors such as delays in prolactin hormone release [46-48], and a reduced milk supply [48]. Medically, cesarean deliveries and poor neonatal birth outcomes also contribute to a lack of breastfeeding [31,49,50]. Physiologically, large breasts become problematic for the baby to latch properly [51] and a small number of studies have reported that obese women are also not comfortable with their body image and are reluctant to nurse in public [52,53]. Additional challenges, such as, poor socio-economic status [45], mental health [54] and intention to breastfeed [29,54-56], negatively impact lactation performance. However, much of this literature lacks evidence in diverse and low-income populations.</p>\r\n<p>Prepregnancy BMI impacts gestational weight gain, for which the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recommended guidelines to reduce risk factors [57]. Overweight and obesity have been linked to other adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes including, infertility, cesarean delivery, and macrosoma risks [31,50,58,59]. Increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is evident in pregnancy data [36,60-63]. The 2013 Prepregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data showed  obesity prevalence rates at 22.6% in 2009, compared to 21.9% in 2004 and 17.6% in 2003 [64-66].</p>\r\n<p>In general, regarding overweight and obesity, there is cause for concern as recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) showed overweight and obesity prevalence of more than 50% among 47 states and the District of Columbia [63] and disparities by race/ethnicity [36]. Blacks were more likely to be obese (34.7%) compared to Hispanics (27.3%) and Whites (22.7%) [63]. The differential prepregnancy overweight/ obesity prevalence rates and related co-morbidities, when coupled with adverse breastfeeding outcomes, signals the loss of potential benefits for improving maternal and child health, posing a singular challenge to meeting Healthy People 2020 goals which aim for 81.9% for infants ever breastfed and 60.1% target for continued breastfeeding for at least 6 months [65,67,68].</p>\r\n<p>Thus, while much of the literature reveals there is a relationship between early breastfeeding termination and high BMI, what is lacking is a deeper knowledge of what additional factors impact such a relationship particularly among lowincome  women. This study evaluates the hypothesis that there is a  relationship between prepregnancy BMI, and early breastfeeding termination among low-income mothers. Therefore, the primary purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which prepregnancy BMI is associated with early breastfeeding termination at 4 weeks among low-income women as well as explore what mother&rsquo;s characteristics best predict early termination. To examine these relationships, we use the conceptual framework, the Life Course  Health Development (LCHD) model, to test the interrelationships among variables. The LCHD model [69], describes the balancing effects of increased and reduced risk factors and protective strategies that uniquely support individual health trajectories.</p>\r\n<p>The specific research questions in this secondary analysis include:</p>\r\n<p>1. What is the relationship between prepregnancy BMI and early breastfeeding termination at 4 weeks postpartum among lowincome women?</p>\r\n<p>2. Which characteristics of the mother (e.g. age, race, experience, BMI, parity and socio-economic status) are the best predictors of early breastfeeding termination at 4 weeks postpartum among low-income women?</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<p>A secondary analysis was conducted using combined data from two studies, Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II) and the Nurses&rsquo; Intervention Project [70,71]. Data sources have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval on record. A full IRB approval was sought for this secondary analysis. The Nurses&rsquo; Study and IFPS II were combined (Diagram 1) as one dataset for secondary analysis. Questions were matched for similar descriptions and recoded to create operational definitions. For example, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) eligibility was defined as low income, between 100% to 185% below the poverty level (United States Department of Agriculture). WIC participation was operationalized by dichotomous responses to WIC enrollment and coded as &ldquo;WIC&rdquo; (1=WIC participation and 0=No WIC participation.) The item was used as inclusion criteria for the study sample. In the Nurses&rsquo; Study, we identified from hospital medical summary the question: WIC enrolled? Yes, or No. In the Nurses&rsquo; Study, WIC enrollment was inclusion criteria, determined from reported financial information [71]. In the IFPS II Neonatal questionnaire, we identified Question N3A: Mother enrolled in WIC in past month? Yes, or No. If yes, mother was eligible for study. The entire sample was enrolled in the WIC program.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Description of original studies</h3>\r\n<p><b>Infant Feeding Practices Study II:</b> The IFPS II is a widely used dataset from a national consumer panel of 500,000 households with pregnant women from across the US. While the initial study, IFPS I, focused on infant feeding from 1992-1993, IFPS II was conducted as a longitudinal survey of pregnant women from the third prenatal trimester to the postpartum first year of infant life from 2005-2007 [70]. The survey was aimed at understanding nutritional activities and practices of mothers and their infants [70]. The inclusion criteria included: women &ge;18 years; women and infants with no medical and feeding complications at birth; singleton birth of at least five pounds; gestational age &gt;35 weeks; and infants with a NICU stay less than three days [70]. Exclusion criteria included: women who experienced disruptions in mail delivery from the US Postal Service as a result of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricane, and women/infants with previous illnesses or who developed long-term health problems.</p>\r\n<p>In this dataset, the sample (n=4902) of respondents were: mostly White (84%), compared to Blacks (5%) and other races (10%); married (80%); college educated (79%); reported high incomes (42%); employed (60%); reported not smoking (90%), and were more likely to have multiple children prior to the index pregnancy (70%). Approximately half were 25 to 34 years, a third, 18 to 24 years (33%), and the rest 35 to 43 years (12%). Geographically, participants were recruited from the West to the Northeastern parts of the US, with more representation (33%) from the South. Data were collected through questionnaires and telephone interviews during the third prenatal trimester and up to 12 months postpartum on variables that include infant/family dietary intake, type of delivery, employment status, breastfeeding experiences, and WIC participation [70]. Questionnaires were mailed to women over a period of 18 months from May 2005- June 2007. Fein et al. [70], reported the prospective study design, high response rate (&gt; 60%), large sample size, detailed content, and the use of pilot-tested questionnaires as strengths of the study. Limitations included lack of generalizability from a large sample of women of higher socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\r\n<p><b>Nurses&rsquo; Intervention Project:</b> In the Nurses&rsquo; Intervention Project (Nurses&rsquo; Study), a randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess breastfeeding rates at 6, 12 and 24 weeks and to determine the effects of a community-based breastfeeding intervention from 2005-2007 [71]. In this dataset, the sample (n=328) were predominantly Black (87%), compared to Whites (5%); young, 13- 17 (10%), 18-24 (59%) and 25-43 years (31%); first time mothers (51%); single (80%); some college education (37%); employed (42%), and in school while employed (22%). Mother-infant dyads were recruited after childbirth from two large urban hospitals, in Baltimore and were randomized into an intervention (n=168) and control group (n=160) [71]. Inclusion criteria were as follows: infant &ge;37 weeks&rsquo; gestation; intention to breastfeed; English speaking  abilities; WIC-eligibility at enrollment; telephone access;  and, residence &le; 25 miles of birthing hospital. Multiple births, babies with medical diagnosis, admission to intensive care at birth, and mother/baby with positive drug test were excluded from the study [71]. Exclusive breastfeeding was not established as most infants received formula milk in the hospital after delivery.</p>\r\n<p>The intervention was delivered by nurse/peer counselor teams, called the Breastfeeding Support Team (BST). The BST delivered a 24-week structured home visitation program with skilled nursing and peer counselor visits; and, telephone consultations, particularly intense during the first 4 weeks. Demographics and longitudinal breastfeeding data were collected; breastfeeding status was self-reported and the date for &ldquo;stopped breastfeeding&rdquo; or the &ldquo;last date of contact&rdquo; was recorded. The usual care group received breastfeeding instructions prior to hospital discharge, 24- hour access to lactation consultants and scheduled postpartum visit with regular obstetricians [71]. Outcomes revealed more women breastfeeding (66.7%) in the intervention group, compared to the usual care group (56.9%) at 6 weeks postpartum (OR 1.17, 95% CI, [1.07-2.76]). Limitations in the study included sampling only English-speaking women and assigning data collection to the support team. Pugh et al. [20], concluded that the intensity of the intervention during early postpartum contributed to high breastfeeding rates and recommended early promotion/support in the first few weeks of breastfeeding prior to return to work, school, or other significant changes.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Study design</h3>\r\n<p><b>Definition of main variables:</b> The dependent variable, &ldquo;early breastfeeding termination,&rdquo; was defined as the outcome of any breastfeeding at one month or 4 weeks of infant life and also referred to as breastfeeding duration, or early cessation of breastfeeding. The IOM [72], definition of BMI (normal, 18.5-24.9; overweight, 25.0-29.9; obese, 30) was adapted for this study and regrouped as: normal, 18.5-24.9, and above normal 25.0-43.30, as a result of an operational decision to reduce the impact of outliers (13.91 and 73.60, M-27.93, SD=7.30). BMI is calculated by: weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m&sup2;).</p>\r\n<p><b>Overview of combined sample:</b> Postpartum women were identified as the target population. The inclusion criteria included: 1. WIC enrollees and recipients; 2. Mothers with prepregnancy BMI ranging from 18.50 to 43.3; 3. Women, &ge;18 years; 4. Black or White race; 5. Mothers of infants born at &ge;37 weeks gestation; and, 6. Mothers of infants weighing &ge;2500 grams, were eligible for the study. The exclusion criteria applied to any cases in the merged sample that did not meet the eligibility requirements. The final sample (n=434) was inclusive of all the criteria. Given the sample size and proportions of overweight/obese women (25.00 kg/m&sup2; and above) in the IFPS II and Nurses&rsquo; Study (29.6% and 27.6%), respectively and based on previous studies, power was calculated at 80% and alpha set at 0.05 [73]. Medium overall effects were obtained for obese and overweight women who were more likely to terminate breastfeeding early.</p>\r\n<p><b>Statistical analysis:</b> The study conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means and standard deviations, were performed for the entire sample and for demographic, pregnancy and breastfeeding characteristics, health belief, and infant characteristics variables such as: age, BMI, education, race, marital status, employment, smoking, previous breastfeeding experience, parity, infant gender, gestational age, and birth weight. Chi-square tests and Student&rsquo;s t-tests were conducted for bivariate analysis to test associations among the independent variable and breastfeeding termination. Correlations were performed to measure the degree of relationships among the independent variables and reported as a Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient (r). Logistic regression was computed using the enter selection method in the final multivariate testing to evaluate the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable, while controlling for covariates. Goodness-of-fit tests, including the Homer and Lemeshow test, a generalized coefficient of determination (R-square), and an adjusted generalized coefficient of determination (adj R-square) were calculated to test the model. One-tailed tests were used to test differences. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS [1], software. A probability of p&lt;.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance for all tests.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Rationale for merging IFPS and Nurses&rsquo; Study</h3>\r\n<p>A careful examination of the methodology of the two studies revealed similarities that informed the decision to merge the data sets. The two studies were conducted during similar time periods, approximately two years apart: 2003 to 2005 (Nurses&rsquo; Study); and May 2005 to June 2007 (IFPS II). Primarily, the studies were parallel in objectives, content, and context. Both the Nurses&rsquo; Study and IFPS II datasets focused on key topic areas such as infant nutrition and breastfeeding; prenatal and immediate postpartum data collection points; and a study design comprised of questionnaires and telephone interviews that helped to match datasets. Prenatal and postpartum demographic variables and infant characteristics were comparable in the two studies. For example, WIC enrollment, education, race, type of delivery, previous breastfeeding history and infant birth weight were identical variables in both datasets.</p>\r\n<p>The racial composition of women in the IFPS II was mostly White, while the sample in the Nurses&rsquo; Study were predominantly Black women. Merging the two datasets provided a unique sample of Black and White low-income women, a representation not found in other studies to advance the body of knowledge among low-income women of different races. While there was evidence of the association of BMI and breastfeeding among White women, a clear link had not been conclusively established among Black women, making this study important. A study sample with such mixed representation would advance the evidence for disparity-related interventions. A combined dataset increases our understanding of relationships by race among prepregnancy BMI, and early termination of breastfeeding.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Analysis</h3>\r\n<p><b>Sample Characteristics (Table 1):</b> The sample (n=434) included all WIC enrollees for whom data were available for computing BMI, and who had a record of early breastfeeding outcomes (stopped or continued) at 4 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed that overall, the sample was comprised of women from ages 18 to 43 years, White (62.9%) compared to Blacks (37.1%), overweight  and obese, (58.3%), multiparous (57.4%), and with previous experience in breastfeeding (48.6%). By week four, about one-third (28.8%) of the women had stopped breastfeeding early, while most (71.2%) continued breastfeeding (Table 1). Infant gestational ages and birth weight (not reported in table) met the inclusion criteria between 37-44 weeks (average gestational age at 39.3 weeks); birth weight 2522-5050 grams, (average weight, 3400 grams). Gender compositions were approximately equal for females (47%) and males (53%). Among this sample (n=434), 18% of women from the Nurses&rsquo; Study were exposed to an intervention from a breastfeeding support team and which was controlled for in this study.</p>\r\n<p><b>Bivariate and multivariate analysis:</b> Eleven demographic and maternal/infant characteristics were analyzed for associations with the dependent variable (Table 2). All variables were introduced for multivariate testing in the final model for characteristics of early breastfeeding termination. BMI was not selected and advanced for testing.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>Bivariate results (Table 2) showed five variables: maternal age, race, parity, previous breastfeeding experience and BST intervention were significantly associated with early breastfeeding termination (p&lt;.05) but not prepregnancy BMI (p=.73). An independent t-test did not yield statistical significance among main study variables. Additional cross-tabulation analysis of BMI with all study variables found significant associations among three variables: age (&chi;&sup2; (1) = 4.26, p=.04), delivery type (&chi;&sup2; (1) =9.69, p=.01) and parity, (&chi;&sup2; (1) =4.15, p=.04). Multivariate results of regression coefficients, using the enter method and after adjusting for covariances, showed breastfeeding experience, BST intervention, age, race, and parity remained strong predictors of early breastfeeding termination at 4 weeks (Table 3). Women with no breastfeeding experience were more likely to stop breastfeeding by 4 weeks (OR 6.15, 95% CI [2.53, 14.62], p=.001); followed by women in the no BST intervention group (OR 3.59, 95% CI [1.45, 8.87], p=.00); and younger women, (OR 2.03, 95% CI [1.13, 3.64], p=.02). Black women were less likely to stop breastfeeding compared to Whites (OR 0.48, 95% CI [0.24, 0.95], as well as, primiparous mothers (OR .39, 95% CI [0.16-0.94].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>This study demonstrated the extent of the relationship between prepregnancy BMI and early breastfeeding termination among a sample of low-income women participating in WIC. The results did not show statistical significance between prepregnancy BMI and early termination of breastfeeding, determined [74- 77], but the results did show that breastfeeding termination was associated with previous experience, maternal age, parity, and race [74-77]. While the sample size many not have been large enough to show significance between high prepregnancy BMI and early breastfeeding termination, these results add significance to the literature in that they are one of the few to examine an entire dataset of low-income women participating in WIC that include a significant number of both Black and White participants.</p>\r\n<p>When reviewing similar mixed sample studies, it was noted the association of breastfeeding initiation and duration with obesity was not significant among Blacks, in one sample of Black and White women [28,40] and in another sample of Black and Hispanic women [41]. Though multiple other studies have documented positive associations between obesity and breastfeeding, particularly among homogeneous White populations [26-28,40,41,74], it appears such results are inconclusive among Blacks when heterogeneous samples are studied. Kugyelka et al. [41], suggested that the reasons for the contradictory findings among Blacks may be due to biological differences, and the belief that the burden of abnormal BMI was unequally shared across racial groups. High BMI among Blacks did not necessarily carry the same adverse outcomes among other races [41]. Additional research on race/ethnicity can provide evidence on the outcomes among overweight and obese women.</p>\r\n<p>Previous experience. This study found that the best predictor for early termination of breastfeeding was prior experience. Our data were consistent with findings for normal BMI studies [78,79], such that the odds of continuing breastfeeding were at least six times higher for women with no experience. In the LCHD conceptual framework, exposure to experienced breastfeeding mothers exemplifies a risk-reducing factor that positively impacts breastfeeding outcomes [71].</p>\r\n<p>Maternal Age and Parity. A cross-tabulation with other study variables, revealed breastfeeding experience was significantly associated with age (p=.00), race (p=.02), marital status (p=.00), and parity (p=.00). Older women, Whites, married, and multiparous women were more likely to have breastfeeding experience [56,80]. Therefore, women with positive experience can provide guidance to inexperienced women.</p>\r\n<p>The findings related to age in this study are consistent with the literature [81]. Younger women (18-23 years) in this sample were more likely to stop breastfeeding earlier than older women at 4 weeks. Younger women were less educated, single, and unemployed, thereby at higher risk for stopping breastfeeding compared to older women, 24 years and greater. The experience of breastfeeding has been proven to be a critical factor in increasing duration; therefore, younger women with first pregnancies should be a focus of promotion efforts. Older women with previous positive experience can help younger women increase the duration of breastfeeding. In this sample, primiparous women continued rather than stopped breastfeeding, which is contrary to most findings, and, possibly the result of the intense early intervention to increase the duration of breastfeeding past the first few weeks. Additionally, peer pressure and body image issues can lead to early termination of breastfeeding [82,83].</p>\r\n<p>Race. Many studies show Blacks trailing Whites in breastfeeding initiation and duration and PRAMS data found Black women were among those with the lowest prevalence (22.1%) of breastfeeding duration [81]. In this sample, however, Blacks surpassed Whites in breastfeeding past 4 weeks, which is an interesting finding. It is rare to find evidence of such high rates of breastfeeding continuation among predominantly lowincome  Black women. Therefore, we delved deeper into the data  to understand the differential findings.</p>\r\n<p>One reason may be found within the composition of the sample of Black women in the original Nurses&rsquo; Study [71]. Among Blacks in this study, about 48% self-described as immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean. It is plausible that the women originated from supportive breastfeeding cultures that were strengthened by the intensity of the intervention in the first few weeks, thereby, boosting breastfeeding rates. Since Blacks in the IFPS II study accounted for less than 15% of the total sample, we surmise that the majority of the effect came from two compounding reasons: the breastfeeding cultural background of the Blacks and from the Nurses&rsquo; Study interventions. The effects of the intervention on Blacks in the Nurses&rsquo; Study is better explained through multivariate analysis; however, race, when offered to the model, suggested that it was not as powerful a predictor, (OR 0.481, 95% CI [.24, .95], p=.035). There is substantial evidence that among WIC recipients, breastfeeding rates are lower than in the general population but are improving where aggressive interventions are introduced [84,85], consistent with our findings among Blacks [64,81]. In this study, it appears that the sample of low-income women became an atypical  group that did not stop breastfeeding in early postpartum (62% versus 28%) due, in part to the intervention in the Nurses&rsquo; Study. While significant, we focused on other predictors since not all participants had access to such an intervention. Participants who received the intervention were included to ensure the study had a large enough sample size that allowed it to best address other variables of interest, however, introducing a limitation as noted.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Strengths and limitations</h3>\r\n<p>The compilation of two data sets told a unique and compelling story of breastfeeding among low-income women. Differences have been found among socio-economic and racial groups, but not many have attempted to control for income. The study addressed the critical immediate post-partum period when women attempt breastfeeding in the home environments and before the ACOG recommended perinatal 4-6-week scheduled visit with healthcare providers [86].</p>\r\n<p>Several limitations were noted in the study. Predetermined variables, definitions and methodology in a secondary data analysis can limit potential findings. Combining two datasets places even more limits on matching and merging variables. The study did not measure the length or duration of breastfeeding, but rather the date when breastfeeding was discontinued, which may, in retrospect, have allowed for a deeper understanding of the variable. The amount of breastfeeding education or intervention provided to each WIC participant was also unknown.</p>\r\n<p>The sample size although large, may not have been adequate to detect differences in BMI. For this secondary analysis, at least 8000 more women would be needed to make a difference. Although adjusted for in the analysis, and affecting only few women, the Nurses&rsquo; Study had the advantage of an intervention that increased breastfeeding duration, whereas the IFPS II group did not receive the same systematic intervention, potentially introducing a bias. The study selected cut-off points that precluded sick mothers or babies from inclusion in the sample, which may reduce generalizability. Women self-reported their weights and heights for BMI calculations and self-reported weight is often underreported, particularly among women with high prepregnancy BMI and may be biased by memory recall during postpartum [87- 88]. The study conducted prior to new guidelines recommending a 3-week postpartum check-in and a complete evaluation at 12 weeks [86] for new mothers.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubtitle target=\">Implications for nursing practice</h3>\r\n<p>Nurses must make appropriate referrals for breastfeeding consultation in the prenatal period, guided by characteristics that best predict continued breastfeeding among overweight and obese women, such as breastfeeding experience. Timely identification of women at risk for early termination of breastfeeding is critical, particularly before the postpartum visit for planning interventions since that lack of support and services after hospital discharge may lead to early termination of breastfeeding [89]. Additional supports and consistent maternity benefits through the Family and Medical Leave Act (1993) across employments [90], leaves few options for women in low-paying jobs in the U.S. to return to work sooner, because of unpaid benefits [91]. The early post-partum period provides an opportune time for nursing interventions.</p>\r\n<p>The LCHD conceptual framework [92] adapted by the study can be useful in providing a structure for planning and implementing early breastfeeding interventions for low-income women breastfeeding women [93-96]. In addition, the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity (22.1%) among reproductive age women from PRAMS data [67], underscores the need to highlight potential health risks associated [31,50,97], with women with above normal BMI. Nurses should avoid making assumptions about who will continue or stop breastfeeding, while recognizing that multiple factors play a role beyond obesity, socioeconomic status, race and background.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>This study explores the relationship among prepregnancy BMI and breastfeeding termination and examines characteristics that predict early termination among low-income women. While we did not find a significant relationship between prepregnancy BMI and early breastfeeding termination, we found out that women with breastfeeding experience were more likely to continue breastfeeding past four weeks. Strategies to promote continued breastfeeding should engage women with experience who have the best chance of sustaining breastfeeding, Women with prepregnancy BMI should be encouraged to maintain breastfeeding, given the preponderance of evidence reported among homogenous groups [24-27,31], even though we did not see statistical significance among women with high prepregnancy BMI and early termination in this sample. We recommend that Black and White women enrolled in WIC remain a target for interventions to meet 2020 goals. Breastfeeding continuation rates continue to lag behind for Black and low-income women. Given the scarcity of breastfeeding studies among overweight and obese Black women, additional research is needed to determine whether prepregnancy BMI stratified by race/ethnicity affects breastfeeding performance. This study adds to the body of knowledge on early breastfeeding termination among a sample of low-income Black and White women with prepregnancy BMI.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgment</h3>\r\n<p>We would like to thank Dr. Linda C.

These conditions include hazards, harms and efforts. Hazards include mechanical hazards, falls and collapses, electric current, fire and explosions, and hot and cold substances, harms include chemicals, biological and physical hazards, and efforts include statodynamic and psychophysiological efforts. Hazards always result in injuries at work, and harms and efforts most commonly cause occupational and work-related illnesses. Harm and efforts rarely cause injuries. Harm and efforts generally cause diseases; occupational and work-related diseases. Although harms and efforts have the same consequences, they are divided into two groups, because harms can be objectified by measurement, while efforts are in principle estimated, and only occasionally can be objectified by measurement, such as measuring the weight of a load being lifted. The job of nurses is at the top of the list of activities with an increased risk of injuries at work and occupational diseases. Health risks in a nurse\'s job arise from exposure to hazards, biological, chemical and physical hazards, and physical and psychosocial effort in the workplace. From exposure to hazards, there is a specific hazard from needles and sharp objects because stabbing incidents, in addition to injury, can result in infectious blood-borne diseases, which are among the most common occupational diseases of healthcare professionals.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Risks; Nurses; Nursing; Care; Health</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Working in the community provides many challenges and opportunities [1]. The transition to a non-hospital setting as a student nurse or embarking upon a career as a community staff nurse, requires health professionals to reflect upon their own and others&rsquo; personal safety, as there will be many situations where the nurse may find themselves working alone. This may include working alone in patients&rsquo; houses, or working out of hours, weekends and evenings where staff are required to access buildings or other work environments. The importance of appropriate induction and mentorship is crucial to staff who are new to the community setting, to prepare and support them in adapting to this new way of working. Working alone enhances the importance of appropriate risk assessment, identification and management in two respects: risk to self and risk to others.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Health Risks</h3>\r\n<p>Public communication does not begin and end with the internet [2]. Where the internet goes now, the mass media have gone before, and continue to go. But public communication in the age of the internet is not what it used to be and it is important to set up some lines of enquiry to find out how it has changed and is still changing.</p>\r\n<p>Public communication about health risks offers a useful point of entry into this territory because health risks are such a universally relevant topic, and the internet, in its public communication mode, is such a universal medium, in principle if not in practice. Although health risks in general are universally relevant, particular health risks of course are not. Not everyone is at equal risk from HIV/AIDS, or lung cancer, or of contracting v-CJD from contaminated beef products. The risks examined in the present volume (cellphones and cancer, SARS, MMR vaccine and autism) were not chosen according to any particular principle, although all of them had at different times attracted mass media attention and all involved uncertainty as to whether there was a risk of the proposed kind, and/or what kind of behaviour would entail running that risk.</p>\r\n<p>The public sharing of information about health risks via the net introduces other considerations. From a &lsquo;top down&rsquo;, social policy perspective, public communication in relation to health risk is all about locating some health responsibilities with the individual, on the basis of knowledge about certain kinds of risky behaviour &ndash; unprotected sex, bad dietary habits, smoking; and public information campaigns are the usual approach. These are unlikely to migrate in full from the traditional mass media to the net because they are less sure of finding their audience in this medium. From the perspective of the individual, traditional information sources may have been issuing confusing and contradictory &lsquo;risk&rsquo; messages, so that the net is embraced as a way of trying to eliminate or reduce the confusion. Or the traditional sources may have compromised their public trust, making the net an option for seeking out different kinds of voices.</p>\r\n<p>E-health applications, mobile electronic devices, and Internet communications also introduce new security risks that require appropriate safeguards [3]. If mobile electronic devices such as PDAs, laptops and removable media (such as memory sticks, DVDs and flash cards) are being used to access PHI, special security measures such as frequent data backups and special encryption procedures must be in place to mitigate the increased risk of loss of, physical damage to, or theft of these devices. Many e-health applications are also becoming increasingly dependent on Internet communications, as outlined in detail elsewhere. The general principles to keep in mind when considering Internet data transfers is that appropriate encryption methods are used to ensure that confidentiality is maintained, the information is not altered during the transfer, and that the sender of the information is always traceable.</p>\r\n<p>Information system security measures need to be taken at every phase, from the inception of the system, to its development, administration and use. When the information system will be administered across healthcare organizations, the added challenge of having to meet the highlyvariable policies and legal requirements of each organization is introduced. Not only is the security of PHI dependent on technology and policies, but more importantly it is dependent on users who employ the technology to abide by the policies in a security-conscious manner. While outside hackers are a concern, internal security breaches are probably more of a threat to the security of PHI, due more often to a lack of education and understanding than the express intent to breach security. It is the user who must not share their password or smart card with others, not log on to a computer and then leave it unattended, not remove computer equipment from secured areas, and not let security incidents go unreported.</p>\r\n<p>The implementation of any new information technology introduces new risk. It is important to identify and classify these risks based on their likelihood of occurring and the impact it would have if they did. By doing this, we are able to balance the benefit the technology provides with the risk that it introduces. It is becoming more common for jurisdictions to legislate risk assessment in the form of Privacy Impact Assessments and Threat and Risk Assessments to identify threats to privacy and security respectively, as well as safeguards against these risks. As technology is constantly being updated, so must we update these assessments.</p>\r\n<p>The use of technology for health is already permeating the patient journey, from prevention to treatment: while there are no diseases, access to specific tools such as mobile applications (or &ldquo;apps&rdquo;) could increase knowledge about possible risks associated to incorrect lifestyle behaviors and help in increasing levels of wellness through self-monitoring of exercise and fitness, diet and nutrition, alcohol moderation, and smoking cessation [4].</p>\r\n<p>Once symptoms of a disease are manifested, a plethora of patient experience tools are available: searching related keywords on the web, specific apps for symp tom checking, social media to share concerns, and tools to find specialized centers if necessary.</p>\r\n<p>In the process of clinical decision making, the physician could base the diagnosis on data acquired directly by the patient using smartphone embedded sensors or connected medical devices that have the potential to record possible pathologic phenomena when they manifested, if symptomatic (e.g., for atrial fibrillation, thus overcoming some existing limitations of well-established diagnostic Holter ECG technology).</p>\r\n<p>Once the diagnosis has been established, the physician may recommend digital tools for condition monitoring, such as app-supported disease management programs, connected sensors for remote monitoring and rehabilitation programs, or apps for psychological and cognitive profiling, and for any use case across the patient journey. In addition, patients could share their experiences, success and failure stories in patient&rsquo;s forum groups specific for the underlying pathology. In the context of treatment, medication management and adherence could be improved by utilizing digital tools, from simple reminders activated through the smartphone to more advanced electronic medication packaging (EMP), or solutions based on active patient involvement and artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Risk Management</h3>\r\n<p>Risk management is an analysis of what could potentially harm people, the environment, the organisation and the public, and subsequently assessing measures of prevention [1].</p>\r\n<p>These apply to all situations that have potential for risk. It is the case that many interventions carried out by nurses carry risks of harm to patients, the nurse and the general public.</p>\r\n<p>Bearing the above in mind, first read carefully any records or notes pertaining to the visit. New nurse should talk to colleagues who may know the situation and local area and who should make sure that any concerns are shared. Things to think about include does the patient live alone, who else is in the house? Are there any previous issues with violence or aggression? Are there any pets in the house?</p>\r\n<p>Always remember that home visits, however welcome by the patient or client, are an invasion of that individual&rsquo;s space. It is important to remember that the nurse does not have right of entry into the patient&rsquo;s house. Even when invited, if the patient asks the nurse to leave, and she does not, then the nurse is actually trespassing.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Safe Care</h3>\r\n<p>Safe care is free from error or harm to the patient [5]. Part of the safety risks identified without the use of EHRs (Electronic Health Records) included the poor legibility of handwritten documents within patient medical record systems. The potential for transcription errors remained an issue due to rewriting onto another paper-based document and potentially rewriting incorrectly from the original document. This could be due to the lack of legibility of one&rsquo;s handwriting or more broadly human error. Any time data or information is transcribed, the potential for error increases. With EHRs, the health data and information would be legible and potentially require less transcription. Thus, the potential for preventable medical errors could be reduced. Additionally, the use of EHR components and functions such as CPOE (Computerized Provider Order Entry) with CDS (Clinical Decision Support) systems, and Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) demonstrated reductions in preventable medication errors. Finally, communication has always been a major factor in the delivery of safe care. With EHRs, the communication of information across health care professionals was another anticipated benefit. By being able to transmit health data and information electronically through computers, nurses, and providers, all other health care professionals could all access the patient&rsquo;s record at the same time and allow for more electronic transmission directly through EHRs in ways such as direct messages or flagged results.</p>\r\n<p>Healthcare delivery has become a complex endeavor whereby differing members of the healthcare team bring important skills, experience, and expertise to bear in the care of the patient [6]. The complexity of the environment is characterized by rapidly evolving, ambiguous situations, complex, multicomponent decisions, informational overload, severe time pressure, severe consequences for error, and performance/command pressure.</p>\r\n<p>This is most pronounced in the Operating Room (OR) and in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) but is present in all settings of health care where physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers work together. This interprofessional and interdisciplinary approach to care has tremendous positive advantages; yet, there are risks that are created through inadequate or ineffective communication among healthcare workers. In addition, when respective roles of healthcare workers are poorly understood or are in conflict with each other, the potential for error is magnified. Finally, the traditional hierarchy or authority gradient between nurses and physicians as well as other members of the healthcare team can undermine teamwork, creating an inability to communicate honestly and effectively.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Care</h3>\r\n<p>The medical and nursing professions have long worked very closely [7]. Increasingly, some primary care tasks are nurse led, with nurses providing the majority of consultations for some conditions, both face-to-face and by telephone. Appropriately trained nurses carry out aspects of intravenous therapy, counselling, chronic disease management, health education and promotion, and audit. Nurse practitioners also have an important role in the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of minor injuries and illnesses.</p>\r\n<p>In hospital care too, the expertise and autonomy of nurses is increasingly acknowledged, with the development of specialist nurse practitioners and nurse consultants. Where appropriate, nurses have consultant support but are able to order investigations themselves and provide continuity of care. Specialist nurses may be responsible for interventions such as cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Patients with some conditions, such as suspected deep vein thrombosis, can be referred to nurse-led services.</p>\r\n<p>Nurses, midwives and health visitors are accountable for their practice and are subject to statutory regulation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The Code: Standards of conduct, performance and ethics for nurses and midwives sets out the principles they are obliged to follow. It is similar in content to the GMC&rsquo;s (General Medical Council) guidance for doctors. Nurses, midwives and health visitors, like doctors, have a duty to acknowledge the limitations in their knowledge and to decline to undertake any duties or responsibilities they consider to be beyond their competence or to be inappropriate in the particular circumstances. They are personally accountable for their actions and omissions.</p>\r\n<p>The hospital nursing staff used an integrative nursing approach to support the health and wellbeing of IR [8]. They were actively engaged in managing the physiological and psychological sequelae of meningeal encephalitis while also attending to the larger healing context. Intravenous hydration was maintained, but antibiotics and anti-herpetic medications were discontinued after the West Nile encephalitis diagnosis was confirmed. Due to concern that narcotic use would produce further nervous system compromise, the medical staff prescribed neurotin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen for pain and fever. Nursing care included ongoing assessment and treatment for his severe headache pain, body aches, dizziness, confusion, and agitation, by focusing on his comfort through timely administration of pain medications and the use of warm/cold compresses, position changes, massage therapy, and Reiki. IR was also having difficulty sleeping, eating, and drinking. They worked together with the family to discuss strategies to improve his nighttime sleep, which included frequent position changes, extra pillows, human presence, and Reiki.</p>\r\n<p>Care for each patient should consider all therapeutic modalities that support healing, starting with the least invasive. Non-pharmacological options such as position changes, hot and cold compresses, massage, and Reiki were used to provide IR comfort and reduce his pain and anxiety. At the very same time, more invasive physiological measures (intravenous therapy and nutritional supplementation) were deemed necessary because IR was unable to take anything by mouth, and essential hydration is required for optimal healing to occur.</p>\r\n<p>The least invasive modalities are those that can be safely administered and for which there is evidence supporting their effectiveness in symptom management. In the case presented, IR&rsquo;s age and neurological status placed him at risk for an unfavorable response to medication: anti-anxiety and sleep medications among the elderly can result in confusion, dizziness, hallucinations, and increased fall risk and in the neurologically compromised patient can further depress function. In other cases, the use of medication may be contraindicated due to pregnancy, allergy, and/or polypharmacy risks. Safety of administration and minimal side effects of non-pharmacological therapies provide a compelling rationale for starting with the least invasive modalities with the elderly, pregnant woman, and children.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Service Structure</h3>\r\n<p>The first step in establishing an optimally functioning department of nursing is to ensure that the structure of the department is well defined [9]. With the ever-changing nature of health care in the 21st century, it is not uncommon that the structure of nursing services has evolved over the last several decades.</p>\r\n<p>Service line models are helpful in managing nursing services in an organization as financial indicators such as volume, market share, and costs are routinely a part of the nurse executive&rsquo;s financial dashboard and are reviewed routinely and acted upon as indicated to ensure appropriate levels of nursing services. Successful service lines have a clear definition of what comprises the service line so that the organization is able to stay focused on outcomes and benchmarks. Characteristics of service line definitions that lead to successful outcomes: (1) the service lines are patient centered to where patients would be receiving services for treatment of a particular issue, (2) the patient population identifies with the service line, (3) the service line improves quality as well as efficiency through the coordination of services, (4) the services cross multiple sites, and (5) there are clear benchmarks to measure the service line&rsquo;s performance.</p>\r\n<p>The development of service lines fall into four phases: (1) service line marketing, which focuses only on marketing services to a particular population; (2) service line leadership, which focuses on leaders being the champion for care of a particular population; (3) service line management, where managers have operational responsibility for the care of a particular population; (4) service line organization, where there is organizational redesign and support services report to the core structure that provides care to a particular population.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Occupational Health</h3>\r\n<p>In the medical and nursing professions there is a diversity of outlets for professional skills [10]. In examining the status of the Occupational Health (OH) doctor and nurse, it is necessary first to analyse the various types of occupational health service which exist today. The main distinction to be made is between the OH service which is set up &lsquo;in house&rsquo; by the employer, and that which is bought in from an outside consultant who is in business on his own account. Most OH professionals who work full time for one employer are his &lsquo;servants&rsquo; (employees) in the legal sense, whereas the independent OH consultants are usually what lawyers term &lsquo;independent contractors&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The importance of all this is that the law divides contracts to sell one&rsquo;s labour to another into contracts of service and contracts for services. A junior hospital doctor or a nurse in an NHS (National Health Service) hospital is a servant employed by the NHS trust under a contract of service. A general practitioner (GP) in the NHS is a self-employed independent contractor employed by the Primary Care Trust under a contract for services. This is not merely an antiquated conundrum for lawyers: it has vital consequences in practice. The employer is liable vicariously in the civil law for the negligence of his servant, but not in general of his independent contractor. Many statutory employment protection rights like the right not to be unfairly dismissed are given only to those employed under a contract of service. The employee has PAYE and National Insurance contributions deducted from his wages by his employer; not so the self-employed independent contractor. The self-employed have the benefit of more generous tax allowances under Schedule D rather than Schedule E, but they cannot claim jobseekers&rsquo; allowance, statutory redundancy payments or industrial injuries disablement pensions.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to the well-known risks, there are a number of new developments and trends that the health and social care sector has to face, and they have resulted in a number of new occupational safety and health challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. They include demographic, epidemiological, social, technological, and cultural trends that affect existing patterns of care. Examples include the growing shortage of health professionals; an aging health care workforce with insufficient new employees to replace those retiring; the emergence of new patterns in the field of health care to address multiple chronic conditions; increased use of technologies that require new skill combinations and imbalances in skill levels and work patterns. These changes affect working conditions and ultimately the well-being and safety of workers in the field of health safety.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1.

Risk factors for the development of hernia include smoking, COPD, BMI&gt;30, pregnancy, collagen vascular disease, peritoneal dialysis, and previous history of open appendectomy [2,3]. A hernia is primarily diagnosed clinically. Inguinal hernia is the most frequent type of hernia and inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common types of surgery performed by the surgeons [4]. Posterior inguinal wall reinforcement can be done by open surgery techniques like Darns repair, Bassini repair, Shouldice repair, and Lichtenstein repair or minimally invasive techniques like Total Extraperitoneal (TEP) and Total Abdominal Preperitoneal (TAPP) mesh repair. In the Laparoscopic TAPP approach, the preperitoneal space is dissected to place the mesh. Lichtenstein repair is done using prosthetic polypropylene mesh, fixed by polypropylene sutures, or by applying self-adhesive mesh to the posterior wall thereby reinforcing it [4]. Postoperative complications including headache, post-operative pain, seroma formation, surgical site infection, and recurrence can occur in both types of repairs [1]. TAPP has a long learning curve but produces better results in terms of post-surgery pain and early recovery to work as compared to Lichtenstein mesh repair. Inguinal hernia repair is the most common elective procedure performed in our hospital both laparoscopically and by Lichtenstein mesh repair. Postoperatively patients remain unsatisfied due to groin pain and discomfort. The objective of the study was to compare postoperative pain frequency and pain score in patients undergoing TAPP and Lichtenstein mesh repair.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<p>This study was conducted at the Department of General Surgery, VMMC &amp; Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi during the time period July 2019 to April 2021. Approval from the &ldquo;Institute Ethical Committee&rdquo; was taken before the start of this study. Inclusion criteria were Age between 20-60 years, Male Gender, Primary reducible incomplete inguinal hernias. Exclusion criteria were a patient having a complete inguinal hernia, recurrent inguinal hernias, bilateral hernias, morbid obesity, acute or chronic kidney or liver diseases, and ASA class 3 and more. Sample Size: Total of 100 patients, 50 as &ldquo;Group A&rdquo;: Lichtenstein repair and 50 patients as &ldquo;Group-B&rdquo;: TAPP Mesh Repair.</p>\r\n<p>Data Collection Procedure: A total of 100 patients were included in the study. The patients were admitted to the department of surgery with the diagnosis of inguinal hernia as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were explained about the procedure and informed written consent was taken. Patients were divided by lottery method the patients in 2 groups. i.e., Group-A and B. In Group A (Lichtenstein group) procedure was performed under spinal anaesthesia. The inguinal canal was approached through a skin crease incision made in supra inguinal region. In the case of indirect hernia, hernial sac was dissected separately from the spermatic cord and a herniotomy was done. In both direct and indirect inguinal hernia posterior wall was reinforced with a 12cm x 6cm polypropylene mesh. The medial portion of the mesh was rounded and a slit was made at the lateral end and the cord positioned between the two tails of the mesh. Mesh was sutured to reinforce the posterior wall with prolene 2-0 taking 6 point fixation in every case. External oblique aponeurosis was closed with continuous suturing by vicryl 1. Skin closed by ethilon 2-0 in interrupted fashion. Laparoscopic hernia repair was done by the 3-port technique. Pneumoperitoneum created by veress needle to achieve intraabdominal pressure of up to 15mm of Hg. 12cm x 15cm heavyweight polypropylene mesh was placed after the creation of the peritoneal flap and reduction of the hernia. To prevent mesh unrolling a single tack was placed in Cooper&rsquo;s ligament. Peritoneal flap sutured by continuous suture with vicryl 2-0. 12mm trocar fascia closed with vicryl 2-0 and port sites skin closed with ethilon 2-0. All the surgeries were done by the same consultant surgeon. All the patients received a single dose of Inj. ceftriaxone 500 intravenously as prophylaxis at the time of induction [5].</p>\r\n<p>Oral feeds were resumed once the patient recovered from anesthesia. All patients received intramuscular Diclofenac sodium 75mg intramuscularly every 8 hours during the first 24 hours, followed by oral Diclofenac 50mg sos for pain. The patient was kept in the ward for 24 hours to observe the postoperative pain assessed by a visual analog scale [6]. The patient was followed up in OPD and pain was assessed by VAS on the 7th day postoperative. Stitches were removed on the 7th day postoperatively. Data was entered in the performed proforma for analysis. Analysis Plan: Data entry and analysis were done using SPSS. Age (quantitative variables) was presented as mean &plusmn; SD. Frequency and percentage were used for qualitative variables- ASA, BMI, type of hernia, and post-operative pain (Presence/Absence). A comparison of postoperative pain in both groups was carried out with the help of the Chi-Square test. Criteria for significance was set as p-value &lt; 0.05. Stratification was done to control effect modification for the following variables (Age, BMI, ASA, and hernia type). Post-stratification chisquare test was applied to see the effect of these variables on postoperative pain in both treatment groups.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>The mean age of patients in Group-A and in Group B was 43.88 &plusmn; 11.21 years and 44.79 &plusmn; 13.88 years respectively. The majority of the patients 55(55.0%) were between 25 to 44 years of age. Distribution of patients according to ASA status showed that 54% patients ASA status was I and 46% patients ASA status was II. Mean BMI of patients was 29.30&plusmn;2.64 (Group-A) and 29.0&plusmn;2.27 (Group-B) respectively (Table 1).</p>\r\n<p>Post-operative pain was found in 36(72.0%) patients in (Lichenstein repair) while in TAPP, it was found in 24 (48.0%) patients with p-value was 0.014 which shows that significantly higher number patients had pain in Group-A as that of patients in Group-B (Table 1). Stratification of post-operative pain with respect to age groups, BMI, ASA status and type of hernia is shown in Table 2.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>The successful hernia repair lies in the outcome like minimal costs, and early return to normal activities. Minimally invasive approach to hernia repair in the form of Laparoscopic (Transabdominal Preperitoneal and Total Extraperitoneal) surgery has now become a choice for hernia repair. The literature claims that patients undergoing laparoscopic procedure has less postoperative pain as well as shorter hospital stay than those patients undergoing open hernioplasty [7,8]. Still, the controversy continues as to which procedure is better than the other. In this study post-operative pain was found in 36 (72%) patients in group A (Lichtenstein repair) while in group B (TAPP repair), it was found in 24(48%) patients with a p-value of 0.014. In a study conducted on 60 patients divided into 2 groups of 30 each, in group-I (open hernioplasty) 53.33%, n=16 reported severe pain whereas, in group-II (laparoscopic hernioplasty), moderate severity of pain was reported by patients (63.34%, n=19). The mean postoperative pain score was 6.23 in group-I and 4.43 in group-II patients respectively. Comparing the mean length of postoperative stay in the hospital it was less (35.10 hrs) in group-I and (38.70 hrs) in group II respectively [9].</p>\r\n<p>It is evident from the literature that laparoscopic repair results in less postoperative pain as compared to open repair. This study showed significant differences in postoperative pain. i.e. (p-value=0.014). For patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures, their pain level was less compared to those patients who underwent open procedures. A literature review done by Memon et all from 29 randomized clinical trials, concluded that there was early discharge and early return to normal activities in patients undergoing laparoscopic than in patients undergoing open procedures [10]. A multicentric trial conducted in Australia by Pokorny H et al reported no significant difference regarding complications and recurrence for laparoscopic and open hernioplasty [11]. McCormack et al concluded that laparoscopic hernioplasty takes longer intraoperative time to perform than open procedure and patients undergoing laparoscopic procedure have less discomfort and return to their routine activities earlier. There was a similar recurrence rate between the two approaches [12].</p>\r\n<p>A meta-analysis published in the UK concluded that both open and laparoscopic hernia repair are effective procedures equally and the choice of procedure can vary from patient to patient as well as it depends on patient preference as well as other variables like nature of work, age, and health status of the patients [13]. Various studies published reported no significant difference for both surgical techniques in terms of recurrence rate and morbidity but the laparoscopic technique requires more operative time [13]. A meta-analysis reported a shorter rehabilitation time in patients undergoing laparoscopic hernia repair [14]. Pereira C et al found that laparoscopic TAPP repair has a longer operative time as compared to Liechtenstein open repair but was superior in terms of other parameters like postoperative pain, duration of hospital stay, and return to normal activity. After a one-year follow-up, none of the patients had any chronic pain or evidence of hernia recurrence [15].</p>\r\n<p>In their study on 100 patients with a unilateral hernia, Jan Z et al, found that there was less postoperative pain in patients who underwent TAPP repair as compared to those with Lichtenstein mesh repair, (p= &lt; 0.05). There were more postoperative complications in the Lichtenstein group as compared to the TAPP group [16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Results of this study demonstrate that Laparoscopic TAPP repair results in less postoperative pain to the patients as compared to Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair and should be used routinely for reducing the post-operative pain increasing the quality of life.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/abdominal-wall-hernia-umbilicus-professor-sir-norman-williams-professor-ronan-connell-professor-andrew-mccaskie/10.1201/9781315111087-60\">Nixon SJ, Tulloh B (2013) Abdominal wall, hernia and umbilicus.

In this context, one cannot ignore the now well-established evidence indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic coexists with vitamin D deficiency [2-4], or earlier meta-analyses such as this one [5], where analyzing 25 randomized controlled trials, subgroup analyses revealed a significant benefit in those who had received daily, hence frequent, doses of vitamin D, with even greater benefit in those who were deficient, of protection from acute respiratory infections.</p>\r\n<p>Historical evidence linking vitamin D to innate immunity comes from reports in the mid-1800s and early 1900s, before the antibiotic era, that vitamin D3-rich cod liver oil and exposure to sunlight were used to treat tuberculosis [8]. Later studies identified the explanation for the therapeutic effects of cod liver oil and sunlight.</p>\r\n<p>In the presence of infection, activated macrophages and monocytes, induced by toll-like receptor signaling and exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-Æ³), strongly express CYP27B1, which converts 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D [9].</p>\r\n<p>Experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, exerts immunological activities on multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune systems, as well as on endothelial membrane stability. An association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels has been observed, and it is recalled that vitamin D deficiency is very common worldwide, [3] and linked to an increased risk of developing several immune-related diseases and disorders, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, sepsis, [10,11] respiratory infections, and Covid-19 [12,13].</p>\r\n<p>Particularly in Covid-19 there is significant overall damage exerted by immune-mediated responses under the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukins, such as IL-6, which may be facilitated by a reduced level of vitamin D or by the aging process. In fact, vitamin D is an immunomodulatory hormone with established efficacy against various upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D can block hyper-inflammatory responses and accelerate the healing process of affected areas, primarily in lung tissue. Thus, there are multiple ecological and mechanistic reasons to promote the exploration of vitamin D action in COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D also plays an immune regulatory role through suppression of adaptive immune responses in respiratory epithelial cells during viral infections. This is primarily manifested by dampening T-cell proliferation and the subsequent switch from T helper type 1 (Th1) to T helper type 2 (Th2) cells [14]. It can be argued that reduced Th1 proliferation results in lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased acquired immune responses, and these can be counterproductive in mounting a successful immune response against a virus.</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin D also influences T-cell maturation and may divert the development of the mass of inflammatory type 17 (Th17) helper T cells toward populations of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (T-reg cells). In this way, vitamin D may reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, TNF alpha and IL-17 while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-10 [15].</p>\r\n<p>Reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines limits the differentiation and activation of various immune cell types and may prevent immune-mediated injury. In addition, vitamin D directly inhibits the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF&kappa;B) pathway, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, through its opposing actions on cytokine regulation and T-cell differentiation, vitamin D plays a complex dual role in immunopathology . Some authors have also postulated that vitamin D may down-regulate ACE-2 receptors and thus may have protective effects in Covid-19 [16].</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that some individuals may benefit from vitamin D more or less than others, as a high interindividual difference in broad gene expression has been observed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to vitamin D supplementation. Although it is still debatable what the optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is, it is advisable to increase vitamin D intake and have reasonable sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D preferably at 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to achieve the optimal overall benefits of vitamin D, because with the exception of some rare situations of vitamin D hypersensitivity (e.g., mutation in the CYP24A1 gene or sarcoidosis), daily supplementation with moderate doses of vitamin D3 is safe [17].</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, therefore, given the available evidence in the form mainly of randomized controlled trials, given that vitamin D deficiency is very common worldwide, and is an easily modifiable risk factor, given the low cost of this vitamin and the absence of side effects, and the protection shown in subjects most exposed to the risk of infection, it seems sensible to invite the population, especially during the winter months and always under strict medical supervision, to the supplementation of this important vitamin, because all in all even a small decrease in acute respiratory infections and Covid-19 infections, would justify this public health intervention.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Covid-19; Infectious diseases; Public health; Vitamin D; Acute respiratory infections; Prevention</p>', '', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1.<a href=\"https://covid19.who.int/\"> World Health Organization (2022) WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard.</a></li>\r\n    <li>2.<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30225965/\">Roth DE, Abrams SA, Aloia J, Bergeron G, Bourassa MW, et al.

They require vitamin K for carboxylation to function properly. When circulating concentrations of vitamin K are insufficient, a greater proportion of MGP and osteocalcin remain uncarboxylated, which is associated with unfavourable outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, lower BMD and osteoporosis [17].</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin K in fact participates as a coenzyme in the formation of the enzyme gamma-Glutamyl CarboXylase (GGCX) within the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyses the carboxylation of glutamic acid (Glu) residues, which once converted to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) increases the activity of Vitamin K-Dependent Proteins (VKDPs). The importance of VKDPs is their involvement in vascular and bone tissue repair mainly through the activity of the bone Gla protein and osteocalcin [3,4].</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, vitamin K3 (menadione) identifies the synthetic analogue, which has no side chain. It also has a water-soluble bisulphite derivative. The two main non-synthetic classes differ in their site of absorption: ileum for vitamin K1, large intestine for K2. In both cases, the molecules enter the enterocytes in the form of micelles and are then released into the tissues following the low-density lipoprotein cycle (chylomicrons, then VLDL and finally LDL).</p>\r\n<p>It should be remembered that vitamin K reserves are limited but can be recycled to a certain extent. The lack of vitamin K2 synthesis in the intestine, which is often the result of chronic dysbiosis, causes profound homeostatic deterioration. The role of vitamin K2 in bone homeostasis has long been overlooked, but its deficiency causes the \'calcium paradox\', characterised by ectopic calcium deposition in places other than the skeleton, in vessels, on bone surfaces (osteophytes) and in joints <strong>(Figure 1) </strong>[5,6].&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin K can also act as a ligand for the nuclear receptor for Steroids and Xenobiotics (SXR) (Pregnane X Receptor, PXR, murine homologue). Evidence has shown that SXRs/PXRs are expressed in osteoblasts and are activated by vitamin K which in turn up-regulates gene expression such as tsukushi (Tsk), matrilin-2 (Matn2) and CD14 involved in bone morphogenetics and formation.</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin K, and in particular K2 in its menaquinone 4 and 7 form (MK 4-7) is able to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by suppressing the expression of RANKL [7-12].</p>\r\n<p>It should be noted that warfarin, an anti-coagulant drug, functions as a vitamin K antagonist that prevents vitamin K activity by inhibiting two vitamin K-related enzymes, epoxide reductase (VKOR) and vitamin K quinone reductase. Long-term use of warfarin has shown bone decay, VKOR subunit 1 (VKORC1) has also been used as a marker for bone condition [13-18].</p>\r\n<p>More and more&nbsp; works analysing data on COVID-19 show how adequate serum levels of vitamin D3 can prevent the onset of the disease, with an important impact on both hospitalisation and mortality rates of patients [19-21], Unfortunately, however, very few studies have analysed the vitamin D3-vitamin K2 synergy [22], which is well documented in the literature, both in terms of the importance of vitamin K2 deficiency and the need to avoid undesirable long-term effects, which could, moreover, aggravate a potential long-Covid syndrome [23,24].</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, therefore, having analysed the problems caused by a vitamin K2 deficiency and illustrated the underlying metabolic mechanisms, although we are aware that further studies and investigations are required, we believe we should recommend joint vitamin D3-vitamin K2 supplementation, in order to avoid dangerous undesirable side effects, especially on the osteoarticular and cardiovascular systems.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Covid-19; Infectious diseases; Public health; Vitamin D; Vitamin K2; Acute respiratory infections; Prevention; Long Covid syndrome</p>', '', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726210/\"> Fusaro M, Mereu MC, Aghi A, Iervasi G, Gallieni M (2017) Vitamin K and bone.

TRUE</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Hip Pain</h3>\r\n<p>As a common and challenging symptom that affects individuals at any age, hip pain may be associated with numerous underlying causes or etiologies. Once hip pain becomes unrelentingly painful and debilitating, those who develop it have no choice other than to seek assistance from their medical providers. Classifying hip pain is important to assess hip pain and improve clinical outcomes. One way to classify hip pain is to allow patients to express their hip pain in one or two ways. This may be accomplished by (a) identifying the origin of the pain as anterior, posterior and lateral [1] and by (b) noting its location as within a joint (i.e., intra-articular), around a joint (i.e., periarticular) or outside a joint (i.e., extra-articular) [2]. Evaluating underlying causes of hip pain requires attentive history-taking, employing pertinent physical examination (PE) techniques, and utilizing practical laboratory testing and imaging studies as essential aids. This review will focus on anterior hip pain in the adult highlighting the presence of Bone Marrow Edema (BME) in osteonecrosis (ON) as a potential underlying cause of anterior hip pain. We present a review of available nonsurgical and surgical treatment options to assist in the management of patients with anterior hip pain, particularly as it relates to BME in ON.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Mechanism of The Hip Joint</h3>\r\n<p>The hip forms the joint between the upper end of the femur (thighbone) and its socket in the pelvis located in the region of the groin. The hip joint is a stable, major weightbearing ball and socket synovial (fluid) joint that allows for significant mobility. Formed by a connection between the pelvic acetabulum (the cup-shaped socket in the hipbone) and the head of the femur (the thighbone), the hip joint forms an articulation from the lower limb to the pelvic girdle (distinctively dissimilar in men and women as to function and size), and thus is intended for stability and weightbearing [3]. Comprised of bone, cartilage, ligaments, muscle, and a lubricating fluid, a hip joint may present differing painful symptoms depending on the cause of the underlying condition and the part of the hip joint causing problems [4].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Common Causes of Anterior Hip Pain</h3>\r\n<p>Anterior hip pain, or pain at the front of the hip, is a common presentation of hip pain seen in clinical practice. Pain in the anterior hip is usually localized in the region of the anteromedial thigh (inguinal regions) commonly known as the &ldquo;C&rdquo; sign at physical examination [2]. Common causes of anterior hip pain are often due to hip joint pathology including Osteoarthritis (OA), ON, or tumor. Acute onset of pain may be due to a labral injury, proximal hip flexor muscle strain or iliopsoas bursitis [5]. Femoral Acetabular Impingement (FAI) produces anterior hip pain that is often worse when moving the hip to the extremes of its Range of Movement (ROM), especially Internal Rotation (IR) and External Rotation (ER). Localized pain to the region of the adductor tendon origins may indicate adductor tendon pathology or referred pain from osteitis pubis). (See Table 1 for underlying causes and differential diagnosis of anterior hip and groin pain.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"width:292.25pt;border-collapse:collapse;mso-yfti-tbllook:1184;&#10;

Trauma-related fractures involving the joint articular surface (e.g., connection between the bones and skeletal system that provides function) may lead to other hip joint destruction such as posttraumatic arthritis [7,8]. General risk factors for anterior hip pain include age greater than 50 years old (for OA), chondrocalcinosis (an age-related matrix change), sex (females 40-60 years old), excess body weight (BMI &gt;40), genetics and certain occupations involving heavy manual work and high-impact sports are linked to hip OA later in life [7,8].</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">ONFH as a Cause of Anterior Hip Pain</h3>\r\n<p>ON, also referred to as avascular necrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis, is associated with many disorders and risk factors that cause mature bone cells to die, leading to bone destruction (e.g., collapse) or end-stage arthritis of the femoral head [9]. As a painful and potentially debilitating condition, ON can occur in any articulating bone in the body (e.g., upper extremity, knee, shoulder, ankles, fingers), or in more than one bone at different times. It most commonly affects the proximal end (epiphysis) of the femur (the hipbone) [9,10]. While the exact mechanism of hip ON remains ambiguous, the combined effects of genetic predisposition, metabolic factors, and local factors affecting blood supply that then leads to vascular damage, increased intraosseous pressure, and mechanical stresses is postulated to result in ON [11]. A consensus among experts suggests that a lack of blood supply to the FH and bone marrow (which produces stem cells and platelets) causes death of the osteocytes (cells within mature bone) and/or mesenchymal cells (stem cells that form cartilage, bone, and fat) [12]. The result is demineralization or resorption of the dead tissue by new but weaker osseous tissue (trabecular thinning), subsequently leading to subchondral fracture (boney destruction) and collapse of the FH [11,13]. As ONFH progresses, there is likely to be an increasing need for surgery involving joint preserving procedures and Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) [14].

In addition, idiopathic factors (spontaneous causes of unknown etiology) are associated with ONFH. Accurately diagnosing and classifying ON are essential in helping to direct treatment options. Identifying associated risk factors and educating patients are important in successful management of ON. Treatments for ONFH aim to manage pain, prevent progression of the condition, improve joint function, and preserve the affected joint. Patient education may improve clinical outcomes by alerting the patient to risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and alternative treatment plans.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Etiologic Risk Factors Associated with ONFH</h3>\r\n<p>General risk factors for ON of the hip include (1) traumatic-associated risk factors, (2) atraumatic-associated risk factors, and (3) idiopathic causes. Traumatic-associated risk factors include, (a) femoral neck fracture, (b) dislocation or fracture-dislocation, (c) sickle cell disease, (d) hemoglobinopathies, (e) Caisson disease (dysbarism), (f) Gaucher disease, and (g) exposure to radiation. Atraumatic-associated risk factors include, (a) corticosteroid use, (b) alcohol use, (c) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), (d) Cushing disease, (e) hypersecretion of cortisol (rare), (f) chronic renal failure/hemodialysis, (g) pancreatitis, (h) pregnancy, (i) hyperlipidemia, (j) organ transplantation, and (k) intravascular coagulation. (3) Idiopathic causes stem from an unknown source. (See Table 3 for differential diagnosis of ONFH.) Longitudinal cohort studies and meta-analyses provide evidence that direct risk factors play a definitive etiologic role in the development of ONFH [15]. Associated risk factors, however, account for more of the links to the eventual development of ON [15].

ON is the underlying diagnosis in approximately 10% of all THA in the US [18,19]. While it affects people of all ages, ON is most commonly seen in patients between the ages of 30 and 65 years [20]. The male to female ratio varies depending on the associated comorbidities [9]. The mean age at diagnosis is typically younger than age 50 years [19]. There is also a high prevalence of bilateral disease [21] (Table 2).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Clinical Presentation of ONFH</h3>\r\n<p>As noted in Osteonecrosis of the Hip: A Primer [9], ONFH typically presents as the insidious onset of persistent pain around the hip joint (located in the groin area). Pain in the groin is the most commonly reported symptom, followed by pain referred into the thigh and buttock. Pain can present with weightbearing or joint motion. Pain at rest occurs in approximately two-thirds of patients with ONFH, and pain at night occurs in approximately one-third of patients [9]. As the condition progresses, painful symptoms may occur more frequently. Pain in multiple locations of the body is rare and suggests a multifocal process. Physical findings of ONFH are generally nonspecific but may entail reduced Range of Motion (ROM) of the affected joint, painful ambulation, Trendelenburg sign, and/or crepitus [9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Bone Marrow Edema (BME)</h3>\r\n<p>BME is a descriptive term and known prognostic factor for a common nonspecific MRI finding that occurs when fluid builds up in the bone marrow. Associated with pain, dysfunction and progressive cartilage damage leading to physiologic remodeling of the subchondral bone [22], BME is commonly characterized by a pattern of ill-defined high signal intensity changes on short-tau inversion recovery and T2-weighted on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Typically, a response to an injury such as a fracture, or conditions such as OA or ON, BME is a major bone component in bone marrow reflecting the presence of rich inflammatory bony tissue containing plasma- T-and B-cells. Often deemed a secondary lymphoid tissue, the presence of BME on MRI indicates that the bone marrow component is essentially involved in the occurrence of inflammation and bone erosions [23]. Excessive water signals in the marrow space on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Ultrasound (US) are characteristic of BME [24].</p>\r\n<p>Rarely found in the joints of healthy controls [23], BME may be the earliest manifestation of ON [17], although it is not specific for ON. Commonly observed in people with ON, BME is often accompanied by vascular congestion (e.g., engorgement of blood vessels with blood) [17]. A large necrotic volume of 30% or more measured on initial diagnostic MR images may be the second useful indicator to predict future worsening of hip pain [10]. In a study of forty-eight hips with high dose steroid-induced ON, BME was not present on initial MR imaging of ON. When BME was detectable, abnormal findings on radiography were slight but 11 (85%) of the 13 hips progressed to advanced ON. BME was highly correlated with the subsequent collapse of the femoral head (p&lt; 0.0001). Based on this study, BME was considered a marker for potential progression to advanced ON, and careful examination for ONFH was deemed necessary when BME is seen [25]. BME also presents in various musculoskeletal disorders, such as osteomyelitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), occult intraosseus fracture, stress fracture, osteoporosis and sickle cell crisis [17]. While BME may occur in virtually all bones, most often it is observed in the lower extremities [17].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Bme In Anterior Hip Pain</h3>\r\n<p>Differential considerations for BME affecting only the femoral side of the hip joint include fractures, ON, osteomyelitis, and neoplasms [16]. Several studies have shown the presence of BME at the FH and neck on MR images in patients with ON, and this signal abnormality has been reported to have a strong association with hip pain and risk of radiographic collapse [10]. As such, BME develops around the surrounding living bone and may obscure subchondral focal abnormalities on MR imaging, thereby creating the possibility of missing subchondral focal lesions [10].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pathogenesis of BME</h3>\r\n<p>Two major mechanisms appear to operate in the development of BME, (1) invasion of the marrow space from the outside in inflammatory lesions of RA, spondylarthritis and enthesitis, and, (2) a localized increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and vasoactive agents in the marrow space due to microtrauma or ischemia in the area as seen typically in macrofractures, local transient osteoporosis, bone bruises, OA and ON [22]. BME gives rise to a water signal on MRI, which may be due to either capillary leakage caused by local change in the capillary wall (i.e., due to trauma or tumor), or by increased intravascular pressure (i.e., due to more blood flow to the marrow or less venous clearance of the marrow space) [24,26]. The increased vascularization provoked by angiogenic factors and capillary leakage induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines each contribute to the &ldquo;water signal&rdquo; seen on MRI.  It is worthwhile to point out that the BME lesion seen on MRI is not a typical edema by histologic criteria [24,26]. Rather, increased vascularization is most likely responsible for the water signal on MRI, characterized by fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and increased vascular congestion [24].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Clinical Presentation of BME</h3>\r\n<p>Patients with BME may or may not show any symptoms. The main symptom associated with BME is pain in the affected bone and the severity of the pain depends upon the underlying cause(s). Pain associated with BME is often debilitating and may limit function and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). While the condition is generally transitory and will eventually resolve on its own, patients may present with significant distress associated with debilitating pain that affects one&rsquo;s overall well-being.  Currently there are no evidence-based guidelines available to provide guidance on how to categorize painful BME. One suggested approach is to subdivide the causes as originating from various pathologies subgrouped as, (a) traumatic, (b) mechanical/degenerative, or (c) idiopathic/ischemic/metabolic [27], thus demonstrating the complexity of painful BME and the challenges presented for proper identification of underlying conditions, the differing causal mechanisms, the underlying disease processes, treatment and prognosis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">History and Physical Examination</h3>\r\n<p>A careful thorough medical history should include a review of relevant past medical and surgical history, medications, allergies and associated risk factors for anterior hip pain and according to potential underlying causes [27]. If ONFH is suspected, questions should focus on history of glucocorticoid treatment, evidence of Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome, smoking, alcohol use coagulopathies, weight loss, night sweats, history of infection, status post arthrocentesis [27]. In the case of acute trauma or recent surgical intervention, we recommend referral to an orthopedic surgeon. A focused clinical examination includes taking vital signs and looking for signs of local infection (erythema, warmth, swelling, pain) and joint effusion. Evaluation of the affected hip compared to the contralateral hip is necessary. When evaluating a patient with reported hip pain, it is wise to ask the patient to point to where the pain is. (For a list of specific evaluation questions about ONFH pain, see Table 5.)  On Physical Examination (PE), it is important to inspect both hips, the skin around the hips, and observe the positions of the pelvis, lower extremities, noting how the patient ambulates. Comparison of each lower extremity (looking for leg length discrepancies) and looking for evidence of an antalgic gait (limp) is important. Evidence of a fever suggests an infectious etiology to hip pain. Focal palpation of the hip should detect the point of maximal point tenderness. ROM testing of the hips includes flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and internal and external rotation. Conducting a thorough neurovascular exam in necessary to evaluate sensory and motor function. Special hip tests including the log roll and the Stinchfield test may be helpful to determine intra-articular pathology [1].</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;&#10; mso-yfti-tbllook:1184;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm;mso-border-insideh:.5pt solid windowtext;&#10; mso-border-insidev:.5pt solid windowtext\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td width=\"534\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width:400.25pt;border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;&#10;  mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt\">\r\n            <div style=\"mso-element:para-border-div;border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;&#10;  mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt\">\r\n            <p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;text-align:justify;&#10;  text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;&#10;  padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;mso-mirror-indents:yes;&#10;  mso-border-between:.5pt solid windowtext;mso-padding-between:1.0pt;&#10;  padding-bottom:1.0pt;mso-padding-bottom-alt:1.0pt;border-bottom:.5pt solid windowtext;&#10;  mso-border-bottom-alt:.5pt solid windowtext\"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">1.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </span></span></b><!--[endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Was there antecedent trauma or inciting   activity prior to the onset of pain?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n            <p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;text-align:justify;&#10;  text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;&#10;  padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;mso-mirror-indents:yes;&#10;  mso-border-between:.5pt solid windowtext;mso-padding-between:1.0pt;&#10;  padding-top:1.0pt;mso-padding-top-alt:1.0pt;padding-bottom:1.0pt;mso-padding-bottom-alt:&#10;  1.0pt;border-bottom:.5pt solid windowtext;mso-border-bottom-alt:.5pt solid windowtext\"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">2.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </span></span></b><!--[endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">What factors increase or decrease the pain?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n            <p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;mso-add-space:auto;text-align:justify;&#10;  text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;&#10;  padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;mso-mirror-indents:yes;&#10;  mso-border-between:.5pt solid windowtext;mso-padding-between:1.0pt;&#10;  padding-top:1.0pt;mso-padding-top-alt:1.0pt;padding-bottom:1.0pt;mso-padding-bottom-alt:&#10;  1.0pt;border-bottom:.5pt solid windowtext;mso-border-bottom-alt:.5pt solid windowtext\"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">3.<span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </span></span></b><!--[endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Was there a mechanism of injury?

Elevated inflammation markers could suggest inflammatory or septic disease.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Diagnostic Imaging</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\" style=\"list-style:none;\">\r\n    <li>a)	Plain film radiography of the hip should include an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and a frog-leg lateral view of the symptomatic hip. The frog-leg lateral view is the radiographic test to confirm subchondral collapse and assists with management decisions. While conventional radiographs play a marginal role in the diagnostics of BME [27-29], plain radiographs are necessary to diagnose the joint, and may give rise to mechanical issues in hip OA and ON. Plain radiographs may demonstrate the presence of asymmetrical joint-space narrowing, osteophytosis (growth of bone spurs), and subchondral sclerosis (thickening of bone) and cyst formation (development of closed, sac-like pocket of tissue) [30].</li>\r\n    <li>b)	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most effective test for detecting the early stages of ONFH, and has shown to be about 98% sensitive and specific. MRI should be used to establish a definitive diagnosis of ON. If diagnosed, MRI images can quantitatively assess the size of the lesion by digitizing the area of the FH occupied by bone with abnormal texture. MRI demonstrates high sensitivity in the detection of insufficiency of occult hip fractures, stress fractures and ONFH. Findings consistent with ONFH include a &ldquo;double density&rdquo; appearance that appears dark on the T1 sequence and bright on the T2 sequence. A demonstrated pattern of ill-defined high bright signal intensity changes on short-tau inversion recovery and T2-weighted MRI images commonly characterizes BME and is predictive of worsening pain and progression of the disease.</li>\r\n    <li>c) Computed Tomography (CT) scan produces a 3-dimensional picture of the bone [31]. CT scan, however, is less sensitive than MRI and has a significant radiation burden. Thus, CT scanning is useful in cases when it is necessary to distinguish pre-and post-collapse disease of the FH.</li>\r\n    <li>d)	Magnetic resonance arthropathy is the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears.</li>\r\n    <li>e)	Ultrasonography is helpful to diagnosis conditions of hip bursitis, joint effusion or functional causes of hip pain (e.g., snapping hip) and can be employed for therapeutic imaging-guided injections and aspirations around the hip.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Patient Education About ONFH and BME</h3>\r\n<p>Patient education about risk factors, therapies, and management is essential for patients to make well-informed decisions about their condition. The process of ON education involves identification of an individual&rsquo;s associated disorders and risk factors related to ON. Boney pain associated with BME is generally a result of the underlying cause (s). As an important prognostic and early indicator of ON, BME pain may reflect the severity of the pain associated with ONFH. The potentially debilitating pain associated with BME and ONFH may limit function and Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Even though the condition of BME itself is generally transitory and will eventually resolve on its own, it is important to acknowledge the distress associated with debilitating pain and how it may affect patients&rsquo; mental and emotional well-being.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Treatment Options in ONFH and BME</h3>\r\n<p><b>Nonsurgical </b></p>\r\n<p>Apart from ONFH, BME as an entity in itself, affects individuals differently. In many cases, BME will resolve with rest, Physical Therapy (PT), and medications including bisphosphonates, iloprost (vasodilator used to reduce arterial pressure) and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). Patients may require several months or more of restful behavior to feel better. In cases with more serious BME, other medical therapy and surgery may be necessary. In general, BME tends to resolve in four to 12 months following an injury. In about 15% of cases, however, the problem lasts two years or more, even in otherwise perfectly healthy persons [32].  Exercise does not seem to increase bone marrow edema in healthy people. A recent study published in Rheumatology finds that osteitis/bone marrow edema as measured by MRI was present in healthy people [33]. However, it did not significantly increase following intense physical activity [33]. Nonsurgical treatment options in ONFH include rest, PT and pain medications [9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Surgical</h3>\r\n<p>Surgical treatment for BME includes injections of stem cells, osteogenic peptides or hydroxyapatite and is reserved for cases where pharmaceutical interventions with either bisphosphonates or iloprost have failed [24]. Core decompression involves surgical drilling of holes in the area of the BME formation to relieve pressure, and thereby reduce pain and increase function. Combining core decompression with autologous bone marrow stem cell injections and bone graft material into the area of necrosis enriches and bolsters core decompression alone. More recent studies report beneficial effects of combining core decompression and injection of hydroxyapatite cement in areas with BME and ON with significant reduction in ensuing pain [24]. Core decompression with injection of autologous bone marrow stem cells are introduced for the treatment of ON of the hip increasing the number of committed osteogenic cells in areas of ON. [24] (See Table 6 for surgical options in BME.)  As noted in Osteonecrosis of the hip: A primer, [9] surgical options in early-stage ONFH include core decompression, bone grafting, BMAC procedure and percutaneous drilling (Lespasio ON PRIMER) [9]. In advanced-stage ONFH, vascularized fibular grafting, osteotomy, nonvascularized bone graft, the Lightbulb technique, the Phemister technique and THA.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;mso-yfti-tbllook:1184;&#10; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr style=\"mso-yfti-irow:0;mso-yfti-firstrow:yes;height:2.35pt\">\r\n            <td nowrap=\"\" style=\"border-width: 1pt; border-style: solid; border-color: windowtext; padding: 0cm 5.4pt; height: 2.35pt;\">\r\n            <p>Core decompression involves drilling holes into the femoral head   to relieve pressure and create channels for new blood vessels to nourish   affected area; 40-100% effective; highest success rates are seen in earliest   stage of disease</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr style=\"mso-yfti-irow:1;mso-yfti-lastrow:yes;height:2.35pt\">\r\n            <td nowrap=\"\" style=\"border-right: 1pt solid windowtext; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; border-left: 1pt solid windowtext; border-top: none; padding: 0cm 5.4pt; height: 2.35pt;\">\r\n            <p>Bone marrow aspirate concentration (BMAC) injection is   investigational; uses patients own adult stem cells; combined with core   decompression</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 6:</b> Surgical options in BME.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To some, BME represents the occurrence of collapse of the FH and is an unfavorable sign in disease prognosis. To others, assessment of the presence or absence of BME may be most useful to foretell worsening of hip pain for patients at the time of onset of hip pain. A large necrotic volume of 30% or more measured on initial diagnostic MR images may be the second useful indicator to predict future worsening of hip pain. Considered a marker for potential progression to advanced ON, when BME is present, careful examination for ONFH is highly recommended. Thus, it is important to recognize the relevance of finding BME in ONFH and its usefulness as a prognostic indicator of disease presence and/or severity.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Regardless of the cause, BME is a known prognostic factor associated with pain, dysfunction and progressive cartilage damage that can lead to physiologic remodeling of the subchondral bone in ONFH. Disabling hip pain with progressive collapse of the femoral head is the main complication of nontraumatic hip ON. Although not a specific finding for ON, BME may be the earliest manifestation of ON. For patients who seek care and treatment for anterior hip pain related to early stage ON, earlier diagnosis provides the opportunity to achieve optimal outcomes. Thus, the earlier the diagnosis of ONFH, the more optimal chance to avoid advanced stage disease and save the native hip joint. Identifying BME early in the process as a prognostic indicator for early stage ON may provide the prospect for hip joint preservation through early detection, treatment and management of ON.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/0101/p27.html\">Wilson J, Furukawa M (2014) Evaluation of the Patient with Hip Pain.

There are many diagnostic parameters represent the presence of a CBD stone. Whether pre, intra or post operatively, it varies from lab works including bilirubin level and liver function tests, ultrasound, Computed Tomography scans (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). [2] additionally, Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) is used for the diagnosis, though it is not recommended to be done routinely [3]. As mentioned above, the presence of a CBD stone includes laboratory and radiological diagnostic predictors, American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines was published in order to help when an invasive procedure is indicated in such cases, the ultrasound findings of the presence of a CBD stone, clinical ascending cholangitis, and a bilirubin level higher than 4 mg/dL are considered predictors to the presence of choledocholithiasis, furthermore the classifications of strong and moderate predictors showed that dilated CBD on ultrasound (greater than 6 mm with gallbladder in situ) and a bilirubin level from 1.8 to 4 mg/dL is considered as a strong predictor. While an abnormal liver biochemical test other than bilirubin, age older than 55, and clinical gallstone pancreatitis is under the Moderate category [4].</p>\r\n<p>In this study we aim to look for the trend of total bilirubin level and its relation to the presence of CBD stone in patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis or symptomatic gallstones undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in order to guide further interventions.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<p>We are conducting a retrospective study at king Saud University Medical City; in which 280 patients were admitted through the emergency department with a picture of gallstones disease associated with high readings of total and direct bilirubin, Data were obtained from patients charts during the period of 2017 &ndash; 2019. The article was approved by the IRB committee in king Saud university medical city. We included adult patients that presented to the emergency department; with elevated total bilirubin and those diagnosed with acute cholecystitis or symptomatic cholelithiasis, we excluded Patients with gallstone pancreatitis, ascending cholangitis, elevated total bilirubin secondary to malignancy, biliary strictures or other chronic disease resulting in elevated bilirubin level The data included Three readings of total and direct bilirubin levels, first reading was taken in the Emergency department upon presentation, the second and third readings were taken on an average time of 24 and 48 hours respectively before intervention including laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus ERCP. The cut off limit of total and direct bilirubin were 68 mmol/l and 5 mmol/l respectively. We aimed to compare between the first and third reading of bilirubin level, to see if any changes in its value was associated with CBD stone passage or not. In addition to the normalization of total bilirubin before intervention whether it is significantly related to choledocholithiasis or not. Furthermore, the Relation of abnormal levels of AST, ALT, WBC, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase to the presence of CBD stone was studied as well.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>The study included 280 patients with a median (IQR) age of 41 (28.5-55) years. Females represented the majority with 184 (65.7%) participants. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most prevalent chronic conditions among study participants with 59 (21.1%) patients in each category. Median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 5 (4-8) days, with patients with identified CBD stone reporting longer durations of stay (Table 1). Total bilirubin was high in 28 (10%) patients overall, with higher proportion of patients reporting high total bilirubin among patients with detected CBD stone. First and third total bilirubin measurements recorded a median (IQR) of 19.64 (8.65-39.85), and 15.19 (8.10-29.81), respectively, with 50% reduction noted among 63 (22.5%) patients of all participants. Moreover, normalization of total bilirubin was reported among 134 (47.9%) patients overall, with normalization reported more patients with no CBD stones. Of all patients, high WBC count, platelet count, AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT levels were reported among 60 (21.4%), 14 (5%), 163 (58.2%), 184 (65.7%), 115 (41.1%), and 204 (72.9%) patients, respectively (Tables 2, 3). Bivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the impact of individual factors on the presence CBD stone showed significant results with first direct bilirubin reading (OR = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.001-1.017; p = 0.029), direct bilirubin before first intervention (OR = 1.028, 95% CI: 1.002-1.055; p = 0.037), high total bilirubin (OR = 3.869, 95 CI: 1.374-10.896; p = 0.01), normalization of total bilirubin (OR = 0.327, 95% CI: 0.127-0.884; p = 0.021), high ALP (OR = 5.637, 95% CI: 1.58-20.16; p = 0.008), and length of hospital stay (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05-1.18; p = 0.001). However, when conducting multivariate logistic regression analysis, only two variables remained statistically significant, with length of hospital stay showing positive prediction (OR = 1.207, 95% CI: 1.04-1.402; p = 0.013), and normalization of total bilirubin showing negative prediction (OR = 0.141, 95% CI: 0.028-0.715; p = 0.018) of the presence of CBD stone (Table 4). The overall model containing all factors was statistically significant X2 = 33.81, p = 0.004, explaining 41.3% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in CBD stone presence.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"width:90.62%;border-collapse:collapse;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;&#10;

prediction of CBD stone presence.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>The presence of Common bile duct stone ranges around 10% in patients diagnosed with gallstones disease [6]. with the different diagnostic modalities for choledocholithiasis ranging from invasive to noninvasive once [2,3], clinicians are moving towards detecting the commonly used lab values as predicators for Common bile duct stones for those going for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our study aimed to select the significant biochemical values and trends to predict the presence of common bile duct stones in order to minimize further invasive and costly work up in patients with symptomatic gallstones or those presented with acute cholecystitis. Our Results proved that High readings of bilirubin upon presentation is significantly related to the presence of CBD stone which supports what was found in the literature [5,6,8]. Additionally, the trend of total bilirubin level was evaluated by comparing between the first and third bilirubin levels with 50% reduction in its value whether it is related to the passage of CBD stone or not, results showed that there is no significant relation in between. Additionally, normalization of total bilirubin was reported among 47.9% patients overall, with normalization reported more patients with no CBD stones, around 7 patients had normalization in the bilirubin levels with no intervention needed, either due to spontaneously stone passage, undergoing CBD exploration and lastly one patient was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent ERCP for palliative stenting and eventually excluded from the study.</p>\r\n<p>Our results Similarly supports what Devin B. Gillaspie concluded, where he studied the Total bilirubin trend as a predictor of common bile duct stones in acute cholecystitis and symptomatic cholelithiasis, they evaluated the trend of total bilirubin level at presentation, 24 hours and 48 hours respectively. It was found that all levels were high in those with common bile duct stones, though the following level over the 48 hours did not improve the prediction of its presence. additionally, [8] Shunichi Shiozawa and colleges studied the Useful predictive factors of common bile duct stones prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones among 510 patients underwent ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, they concluded that jaundice, pancreatitis, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and CBD dilatation at ultrasonography are independent predictive factors of CBD stones. [5].</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, Practical recommendations for the prediction and management of common bile duct stones in patients with gallstones was published by N A Kama et al. where he evaluated 986 patients with underwent cholecystectomies from 1994 through 1999, it was found that ultrasound is considered a practical predictor for common bile duct stones in patients under the age of 70 while older populations elevated direct or total bilirubin level is the one suggesting to go for preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography [6] Predrag Jovanovic and others conducted a study focusing on the Biochemical and ultrasound parameters that may help predict the need for therapeutic Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with a firm clinical and biochemical suspicion for choledocholithiasis among 203 patients, results showed that out of the laboratory findings Gamma Glutamil Transaminase (GGT) was found to be a significant predictor for choledocholithiasis, additionally Common Bile Duct (CBD) diameter and presence of hyperechoic structures in CBD were also found to be significant predictors as proven by ERCP [7]. We also evaluated Other biochemical markers, the relation between AST, ALT, WBC, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase to the presence of CBD stone showed that ALP being the only laboratory test that is significant with a p value of 0.008, in comparison to which was found in the literature where Devin B. Gillaspie found that the trend of  White blood cells and ALT being statically related to the presence of common bile duct stones while the trend of AST, alkaline phosphatase nor platelets showed any evident relationship [8]. We faced many limitations were faced in our study, including the variety of time of patients&rsquo; presentation at the time the bilirubin level was taken, the nature of the study being a retrospective one. Yet both direct and total bilirubin in addition to the other liver function biochemical markers were evaluated in order strengthen the resulted data.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>High readings of b', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://misuse.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/error/abuse.shtml\">Informed Health.org (2012) Cologne, Germany: Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG); 2006-.

Human coronaviruses can cause mild disease similar to a common cold, while others cause more severe disease (such as MERS-Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and SARS-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyper immune immunoglobulins. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19; SARS-CoV; MERS-CoV; Hyper immune immunoglobulins</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Covid 19 belongs to the coronavirus family, which also includes the SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Symptoms) virus.

The current scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely related mammal.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Epideomiology</h3>\r\n<p>Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019, cases have been reported in all continents. Globally, over 500 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Updated case counts in English can be found on the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control websites. An interactive map highlighting confirmed cases throughout the world can be found here.</p>\r\n<p>The reported case counts underestimate the overall burden of COVID-19, as only a fraction of acute infections are diagnosed and reported. Seroprevalence surveys in the United States and Europe have suggested that after accounting for potential false positives or negatives, the rate of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as reflected by seropositivity, exceeds the incidence of reported cases by approximately 10-fold or more .One study that used multiple data sources, including databases on case counts, COVID-19-related deaths, and seroprevalence, estimated that by November 2021, over 3 billion individuals, or 44 percent of the world&rsquo;s population, had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least once. Approximately one-third of the total cases were estimated to have occurred in South Asia (including India).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discovery</h3>\r\n<p>The first known infections from SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pathophysiology</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/userfiles/image2.png\" width=\"605\" height=\"228\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Diagnosis</h3>\r\n<p>Diagnosis allows suspected people to understand that they are infected or not. Diagnosis can help them receive the care they need and it can help them take measures to cut back the probability of infecting others. People who don\'t know they are infected may not occupy at home and thereby risk infecting others. If the person develops symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 and they have been exposed to the virus, he should consult to doctor. The doctor may decide whether to conduct tests for COVID-19 based on individual signs and symptoms. The doctor may also consider whether an individual had close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 or travelled to or lived in any areas with ongoing community spread of COVID-19 within last 14 days. Coronavirus Disease-2019 tracking and diagnostic testing are critical and also critical to understanding epidemiology, informing case management, and to suppressing transmission. The Coronavirus disease outbreak is additionally typical to prevent virus community transmission, including how testing might be rationalized when lack of reagents/ testing kit or testing capacity necessitates prioritization of certain populations group or individuals for testing.&quot; To test for COVID-19, doctor or health practitioner may take samples, including a sample of saliva (sputum), a nasal swab and a throat swab, to send to a lab for testing or follow the directions of your local health authority.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Transmission</h3>\r\n<p>Person-to-person spread is the main mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Route of person-to-person transmission-Direct person-to-person respiratory transmission is the primary means of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It is thought to occur mainly through close-range contact (i.e., within approximately six feet or two meters) via respiratory particles; virus released in the respiratory secretions when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks can infect another person if it is inhaled or makes direct contact with the mucous membranes. Infection might also occur if a person\'s hands are contaminated by these secretions or by touching contaminated surfaces and then they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, although contaminated surfaces are not thought to be a major route of transmission.</p>\r\n<p>SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted longer distances through the airborne route (through inhalation of particles that remain in the air over time and distance), but the extent to which this mode of transmission has contributed to the pandemic is uncertain. Scattered reports of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks (e.g., in a restaurant, on a bus) have highlighted the potential for longer distance airborne transmission in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces. Experimental studies have also supported the feasibility of airborne transmission. As examples, studies using specialized imaging to visualize respiratory exhalations have suggested that respiratory droplets may get aerosolized or carried in a gas cloud and have horizontal trajectories beyond six feet (two meters) with speaking, coughing, or sneezing. Other studies have identified viral RNA in ventilation systems and in air samples of hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19, including patients with mild infection ,attempts to find viable virus in air and surface specimens in health care settings have only rarely been successful. Nevertheless, the overall transmission and secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that long-range airborne transmission is not a primary mode. Furthermore, in a few reports of health care workers exposed to patients with undiagnosed infection while using only contact and droplet precautions, no secondary infections were identified despite the absence of airborne precautions. Recommendations on airborne precautions in the health care setting vary by location; airborne precautions are universally recommended when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>In settings where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, personal measures to reduce the risk of transmission include mask wearing in public, diligent hand washing, respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, and avoiding crowds, poorly ventilated areas, and close contact with ill individuals.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Treatment</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/userfiles/image3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Coronavirus Vaccine</h3>\r\n<p>Vaccines are now available for children as young as 5 years old. These vaccines are a third the dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which is authorized in those 12 and older. As in the adult version, the children\'s version requires two does, take 3 weeks apart.</p>\r\n<p>COVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there\'s no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Myth Busters</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?</h3>\r\n<p>No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?</h3>\r\n<p>No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Can gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus?</h3>\r\n<p>No. There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Some brands or mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?</p>\r\n<p>Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?</h3>\r\n<p>No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.</p>\r\n<p>The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.</p>\r\n<p>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene?</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus disease continues to spread across the world following a trajectory that is difficult to predict. The health, humanitarian and socio-economic policies adopted by countries will determine the speed and strength of the recovery. Antiviral agents are useful to inhibit the clinical progression and complications of COVID-19. Future studies are needed to identify specific targets that inhibit the life cycle of SARS-COV-2 to prevent its replication and that, if used early, could avoid the characteristic complications of COVID-19.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.07.21267432v1.full.pdf\"> Wilhelm A, Wildera M, Gikscheit K, Toptan T, Schenk B, et al.

Several studies have shown that this moving population has specific health problems that differ from the common health problems of the host country. Some diseases, such as intestinal parasitosis, can have serious health consequences if not diagnosed and treated. In this study, we tested an in-house real-time PCR to detect S. Stercoralis, N. Americanus, and A. Duodenale on asylum seekers hosted in the reception centers of Padova, Italy. The screening was done on a voluntary basis, and the results were shared with health authorities to provide medical assistance to those who were infested. We used the agar culture method as the gold standard. For each volunteer, two faecal samples were collected (one fresh and the other fixed in a storage medium). The fresh samples were cultured by the agar plate technique, while the fixed samples were concentrated and observed under the light microscope. All samples were also analysed by real-time PCR with probes designed to detect the three helminths. Our results indicate a high prevalence of helminthiasis in the population examined, as 9 out of 81 (11%) samples showed the presence of helminths by the culture method of which 5 samples were identified as N. Americanus by PCR. All positive subjects were clustered among young males from Nigeria. These results strongly suggest that predictions on the prevalence of helminthiasis in immigrants may be incorrect due to the heterogeneity of their living conditions before immigrating and that, the adoption of regular screening programs for the detection of intestinal parasites in asylum seekers is highly recommended to provide the best medical care. The low sensitivity shown by the PCR methods underlines the difficulties to use this method on faecal specimens in particular to detect helminths. To have the highest sensitivity we suggest, when possible, using culture-based methods, that are more broad-spectrum, with PCR tests that, when working properly, give a fast species identification.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Worm&rsquo;s infections; Immigrant&rsquo;s health; Screening programs; Italy; Culture method; Real-time PCR</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Every year Europe receives an influx of asylum seekers from African countries; in 2018, the rough number of immigrants was 144,166 [1]. This phenomenon is not constant with yearly shifts in numbers and ethnic composition of the refuge seekers due to the rapidly evolving social and political conditions in those regions. While in 2017, the main nationalities were predominantly from western and central Africa, in 2018, the number of refugees from the Middle East and South Asia has steeply increased [1].</p>\r\n<p>Refuge seekers have unique health characteristics. They present fewer chronic diseases, widespread in European countries, lower average age, and the &quot;voyage bias&quot;, that is, only the healthiest and best-fitted decide to start a long and challenging journey [2,3]. On the other hand, immigrants are exposed to pathogens in their origin countries that are no longer common in European countries, such as zoonotic diseases and parasitosis. Therefore, when asylum seekers are screened for health problems in the host country, it is essential to look for these diseases, which could have severe consequences for those affected [4]. In this scenario, it is also advisable to have a fast diagnosis to treat the affected one while still in the host center. To do so the biomolecular tests often offer a quicker and more automatized way to detect or characterize a pathogen. So, it would be valuable to use these techniques in the screening for parasitic infection in asylum seekers.</p>\r\n<p>Among the various illnesses to be considered, intestinal parasitic infections, particularly those caused by geo-helminths, are of great importance. While in Europe, intestinal parasites are no longer considered a cause of disease due to their low prevalence [5], in many African countries, they are still considered pathogens of concern. Their prevalence varies depending on region and by helminth species, but values between 10-20% are considered realistic [6-9]. It is important to diagnose these conditions due to the morbidity and mortality associated with geo-helminthiasis, particularly for the silent progression of chronic infections that can lead to serious complications when the host\'s immune system weakens [10,11] Children are particularly exposed to the damage of chronic helminthiasis since they can have a greater risk of malnutrition-related problems and other growth disorders [4,12].</p>\r\n<p>These considerations are important in Italy since it is one of the main arrival countries for people from African regions seeking asylum in Europe. In 2018, there were 23,370 new arrivals registered in Italy, i.e. five times fewer refugees than the 119,369 immigrants registered in 2017 and seven times less than the 181,436 registered in 2016. The main African countries of origin were Tunisia (22%), Eritrea (14%) and Sudan (7%) and, from the Middle East area, Iraq (7%) and Pakistan (7%) [13,14].</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a real-time PCR test to detect three of the more common parasitic helminths: Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Strongyloides stercoralis. The molecular test was performed along with the standard culture method, which was used as a reference gold standard. The population studied was the asylum seekers hosted in a reception center in the city of Padova. The tests were performed on a voluntary basis and with the approval of the administrative and public health authorities. The infected subjects were offered therapy. The data collected are also helpful to monitor the prevalence of parasitosis in refuge seekers and better understand and approach their health problems.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sample collection</h3>\r\n<p>The volunteers were enrolled in Padova (Italy) in the last months of 2018 and the first months of 2019. As in other Italian cities, refuge seekers are accommodated at reception centers managed by the public administration, where they live and receive health care while waiting for their asylum applications to be evaluated. After the approval by Italian immigrant affairs authorities, we contacted the reception centers to screen the asylum seekers for intestinal helminthiasis. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The work was carried out by the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association and informed consent was obtained from participants.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, the people willing to participate were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire about their general data (sex, age, country of origin) and the present or past physical symptoms that could be related to intestinal parasitosis (Table 1). Then, we provided them with two containers for the collection of one fresh faecal sample and one preserved with a fixative solution (Para-Pak&reg; ULTRA SVT; Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, USA). An identification code was assigned to each faecal sample. The shelter management registered the match between the identification code and the participant\'s identity to treat subsequently those who resulted infested. The samples were analysed at the Laboratory of Microbiology of the University-Hospital of Padova, Italy. The diagnostic work focused on the three major intestinal helminths, i.e. Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis), Necator americanus (N. americanus), and Ancylostoma duodenale (A. duodenale). All samples were analysed using traditional (culture plates of fresh faecal samples and microscope observation of parasite eggs in preserved faecal samples) and molecular techniques as described below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/userfiles/table1(1).png\" width=\"779\" height=\"1808\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1: </b>Study subjects.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Analysis of fresh stool samples by the agar culture plate method</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A small quantity, half of a walnut, of each fresh stool sample was loaded on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) (triplicate plates) and then incubated at 30&deg;C. After 5 to 7 days, the plates were examined under an optical microscope at 50X magnification. With this technique, the larvae of nematodes are visible in the agar plate as they move from the faecal material into the culture medium leaving winding paths behind (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Analysis of preserved stool samples</h3>\r\n<p>Upon arrival in the laboratory, the faecal samples collected in Para-Pak&reg; ULTRA SVT containers were stirred for 15 minutes, before proceeding with the concentration method. The SpinCon&reg; Concentration System (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) was used to obtain a small amount of concentrated sample for evaluation under a light microscope, according to the manufacturer\'s instructions. A drop of the concentrated sample was then placed on top of a glass slide and the sample was observed under the light microscope using 100X and 400x magnifications to detect parasite eggs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/userfiles/Figure 1(4).jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"199\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> Presence of nematodes in fresh stool samples with the agar plate culture method.

Also, nine samples tested negative at the culture and microscopic methods were analyzed with the real-time PCR procedure in order to determine the specificity. The fresh and preserved samples were centrifuged at 13.000 rpm in a microfuge for 2 minutes. A small amount of each sample was then dissolved in 420 &micro;L of a solution containing lysis buffer (180 &micro;L; Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 40 &micro;L of proteinase K (20 mg/ml), and purified water (200 &micro;L). Samples were incubated at 65&deg;C for 30 minutes, then at 99&deg;C for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at 13.000 rpm in a microfuge for 30 seconds. The supernatant (400 &micro;L) was then transferred into a clean tube and DNA extracted employing the MagNa Pure compact instrument (Roche), using the DNA bacteria V3.2 program, to remove faecal inhibitors, such as bile salts and complex polysaccharides [15], and to obtain 200 &micro;L of purified DNA extract. Aliquots (5 &micro;L) of each extraction eluate were tested by Real-Time PCR assays in four independent reactions for the detection of DNA of S. Stercoralis, N. Americanus, and A. Duodenale (single reactions for each nematode) and, in parallel, with an amplification reaction of positive control (i.e. phocine herpesvirus, PHO-CI). Real-time PCR reactions were run in 96 well plates employing the ViiA7 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Each PCR process had a negative control represented by Milli-Q water to exclude the presence of contaminating molecules from the fieldwork. The reaction protocol was: 20 seconds at 95&deg;C for DNA denaturation, followed by 45 amplification cycles (1 second at 95&deg;C, 20 seconds at 60&deg;C for primer annealing and polymerization). In each real-time PCR reaction, 900 nmol of primers and 300 nmol of probes were used.</p>\r\n<p>The positive control was prepared alongside the other samples in order to detect errors or inhibitors present in the procedure. The ct value of the positive control was used as a comparison for the ct values of the samples. If the ct values of the positive samples were far greater compared to the positive control it was assumed that the DNA eluate contained too many PCR inhibitors and therefore the extraction process of those samples was repeated. The extraction and amplification were repeated also for all samples testing negative at the first Real-time PCR reaction. Primers and probes for S. Stercoralis were designed on the gene sequence of the ribosomal 18S	subunit	rRNA	(Gene	Bank	accession	number:	AF279916):	Stro-Forward,	5&rsquo;-AAGGCTGAGAGACATATTCAAAAGTG-3\'; Stro-Reverse, 5&rsquo;-ACCACAAAAACAACAAAAGTTGGA-3\'; Stro-Probe 5\'- CGCACTAGAATAAACTCCACT-3\'. The expected fragment is 72 bp long. Primers and probes for A. Duodenale and N. Americanus were designed on the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) gene (Gene Bank accession number: AJ001594 for A. duodenale and AJ001599 for N. Americanus):	Ayd-Forward:	5&rsquo;-GCCACTGCCGAAACGTTCTA-3\';	Ayd-Reverse:	5&rsquo;-GAATGACAGCAAACTCGTTGTTG-3\'; Ayd-Probe: 5\'- AGTCGGTAAACGATTCAG-3\'; Nec-Forward: GGTTGGGTGACGGCTATGAT-3&rsquo;; Nec-Reverse: 5&rsquo;- TGCACACGCACACATACAACA-3&rsquo;; Nec-Probe: 5&rsquo;- CTTGGCAAAGTTCGC-3&rsquo;. The expected fragments were 65 and 64 bp long for A. duodenale and N. americanus, respectively. Primers and probes for the internal control were designed on the gB gene of Phocine herpesvirus type 1 (PHO-CI) (GenBank accession number Z68147): Pho-Forward: 5\'-TGAGAGAAATTTTGGGCGAATC-3\';	Pho-Reverse:	5\'-CAGATGGTGGCGGACACAT-3\';	Pho-Probe: VIC-5\'-TTGAATCTGATGATACAGCAAC-3\'-MGB. The primers generate a 65 bp long fragment. The fluorophores used to label the probes was FAM-MGB (S. stercoralis, N. americanus) and VIC-MGB (PHO-CI, A. duodenale). The plasmid containing the PHO-CI fragment was generated as follows. A 65 bp PHO-CI long fragment was produced by the PCR: 10 minutes at 95&deg;C for the initial denaturation, followed by 45amplification cycles (15 seconds at 95&deg;C and 1 min at 60&deg;C of annealing and polymerization), followed by an elongation cycle at 72&deg;C for 7 minutes. This fragment was then cloned in the EcoRV site of the p-GEM-T easy vector (Promega), transfected in E. coli cells produced, and purified according to standard procedures.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results and Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>A total of 81 asylum seekers hosted in Padova\'s shelters agreed to participate in the study (Table 1). All of them provided the faecal sample but a minority filled out only partially the personal questionnaire. The median age was 26.6 years, with the oldest volunteer being 42 and the youngest 19 years old. The sex distribution was unbalanced towards males who represented 85% of the total. These data are in agreement with the data of similar studies performed in Europe [16,17]. Ninety-five percent (95%) of asylum seekers came from Africa whereas 5% from Bangladesh. Among the African participants, the country of origin was reported only for 53 out of 81 subjects (65.4%). In particular, among asylum seekers with a known country of origin, the majority came from Nigeria (49%), around 28.3% came from Ivory Coast, Guinea, and Senegal, and 22,6% came from Cameroon, Mali, Gambia, Eritrea, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Togo, in agreement with the more common countries of origin among immigrants in Italy during 2017, but different from the data reported for 2018 when the more frequent nationalities were Tunisian, Eritrean, Sudanese, Iraqi and Pakistani [1,13].</p>\r\n<p>The analysis of fresh and preserved faecal samples showed that none of the 81 fixed and concentrated samples resulted positive for parasite eggs by microscopy observation (data not shown), whereas 9 out of 81 fresh samples analysed by the agar plate culture method were positive for the presence of worm larvae (Figure 1, Table 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/userfiles/table2(2).png\" width=\"729\" height=\"608\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 2:</b> Positive faecal samples analysed with traditional and molecular techniques.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Altogether, by means of the fresh culture method, we found a prevalence of helminth infection in 11,1% of asylum seekers housed in the reception centers in Padova. These results underline the greater sensitivity of the agar plate culture method, compared to the direct observation of concentrated samples, in agreement with other studies showing that the agar culture method is the most sensitive for hookworm detection among non-molecular diagnostic tools [18-21]. In our study the collection of samples of stool from the participants at an only one-time point may have probably further increased the difference in sensibility between the two techniques, leading to zero positive cases by microscopy observation against nine positive samples by the agar method.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The prevalence of helminths here reported is in the range of 3-10% reported by different studies [16,22,23], but higher than the data reported by Ehlkes, et al. [24]. The prevalence of intestinal parasites in asylum seekers in Italy shows, however, significant differences [25], reflecting the high heterogeneity of the immigrants which, in turn, depends significantly on differences in their countries of origin and prior living conditions. This may explain the higher prevalence of intestinal parasites found in our study compared to studies analysing a higher number of cases [16]. All the 9 positive subjects found in this study belonged to a cluster sharing the same country of origin, Nigeria, and a similar age range, i.e. 20-35 years old. Furthermore, 8 out of 9 positive subjects were male. Without this cluster of 9 people, our study probably would have reported a much lower prevalence of helminths among the population screened. These observations suggest that disease prevalence in asylum seekers should not be taken as a constant value and, therefore, particular attention must be paid to defining health strategies on this issue.</p>\r\n<p>Both the preserved and the fresh samples of each positive subject were tested by PCR to determine if the molecular method can replace the classical methods and in order to identify the parassite. Five fresh samples out of the nine positives by the culture method turned out to be positive by PCR for N. americanus whereas the other four samples positive for the presence of larvae tested negative by PCR for all three nematodes, S. stercoralis, N. americanus, and A. duodenale. In contrast, all preserved samples resulted negative. Also, all nine samples negative with the culture method, used as controls to determine the specificity of the test, correctly tested negative at the PCR assay.</p>\r\n<p>Several studies show that PCR-based diagnostic methods for helminthiasis are more sensitive than conventional methods, in particular direct microscopy [26-30]. However, it was also reported that PCR analysis was less sensitive compared to some direct methods [31,32]. Our results confirm the latter observation since we detected several positive cases of helminth infection using the culture technique on fresh samples compared to direct microscopy and molecular assay.</p>\r\n<p>Several hypotheses may explain the difference in the results between the culture and the PCR methods reported in this study. Based on the results of the positive and negative controls, and the observation that the samples with a negative PCR outcome were extracted and analyzed twice confirming the negative PCR result, it is unlikely that the difference between the two methods was due to stool interfering factors in the PCR process. For each worm, the primers designed and used in this study were indeed validated on positive samples. For S. Stercoralis they were validated on fecal material from one patient infected with this nematode detected during our laboratory diagnostic routine. Instead, for N. Americanus and A. Duodenale it is particularly difficult to obtain fresh positive samples, to use as controls, because they are not endemic in our country but occasionally detected only in voyagers and immigrants who are, however, not routinely screened for parasitic infections. Thus, primers of N. Americanus and A. Duodenale were validated on purified DNA of the two helminths, provided by the &ldquo;Infectious Diseases&rdquo; laboratory of the Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital (Negrar, Verona, Italy), which were purified from two positive cases diagnosed in the past. Another issue could be the amount of DNA that can be extracted from the faeces of positive samples since it may vary depending on the number of worms, the stage of the larvae, the processing of the samples, and still other factors that help or interfere with the release of nucleic acids from the worms in the faeces. Of note, all infected subjects didn&rsquo;t report gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of the sample collection suggesting that they had a mild infestation and the number of parasites, and therefore the amount of nucleic acids, was very likely low. In addition, during their voyage from their original country to the host country, asylum seekers are hosted in various refugee camps where they may have routinely received anti-helminth drugs further reducing the worm burden in the infected subjects. A further hypothesis for the discrepancy from culture and PCR results is that the worms observed with the culture method may have a genetic variation in the locus detected by the PCR that hinders the process or belong to species different from the three searched here, for example Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Oesophagostomum bifurcum, often reported to cause infections [33-35].</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, based on these results we strongly recommend the adoption of regular screening programs for the detection of intestinal parasites in asylum seekers. These infections have a huge impact on health, in particular, if the infected subject suffers from a condition of impaired immunity. It is also important to consider the &quot;clusters&quot; phenomenon we have observed in the epidemiological distribution of the positive cases. The prevalence of diseases in this kind of population appears to vary significantly and even the presence or absence of a few people can modify greatly the overall rate of positive cases. So, it seems not advisable to make predictions on the prevalence of helminthiasis in immigrants due to the high variability of the living conditions they had before engaging in the emigration journey.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the results of our diagnostic process, we showed that the molecular methods could be useful for the precise and rapid identification of pathogens at the species level avoiding conventional systems that are more time-consuming and rely on the individual\'s ability to recognize phenotypic characteristics. On the other hand, the real-time PCR process limits the possibility of diagnosing only the specific pathogens for which the reaction primers are designed. The process may be also easily hindered by inhibiting factors in the faeces, and by the burden of the infection, that influence the amount of parasites in the sample. Thus, to have an accurate diagnosis of helminthiasis, it is still advisable to combine real-time PCR tests with a broad-spectrum assay such as the agar plate culture.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgments</h3>\r\n<p>We would like to express our best thanks to the following people and institutions for the help they provided to this study: Dott.

The deep veins accompany the arteries and are referred to as venae commitantes. They are named after their corresponding arteries. Thus, like the arteries, they are nicknamed thus: anterior(dorsalis pedis) and posterior, popliteal and femoral veins. The superficial veins comprise of the great saphenous, the small saphenous veins and their corresponding perforators [1-3]. Particularly for the Great Saphenous Vein (GSV), the perforators are Cocket I(5cm), Cockett II(10cm) and Cockett III(15cm) from the medial malleolus respectively. The others are Dodd(knee region) and Boyd(Hunter&rsquo;s canal ) perforators and finally the saphenofemoral junction at the cribriform fossa, 3 cm inferiorlateral to the pubic tubercle [4,5]. The saphenofemoral junction perforator is accompanied consistently by four superficial veins, namely: superficial, deep pudendal, superficial and circumflex iliac veins. These tributaries must be sought and ligated during the flush ligation of the sapheno-femoral ligation for the incompetence of the associated valve so as to avoid recurrence [6]. The lower extremity veins drain towards the heart (cephalad) against gravity, i.e. they drain from distal to proximal [7,8]. This is made possible by the presence of valves. The pressure in the deep veins is higher than their superficial counter parts, yet the drainage is from superficial to deep. This is made possible by presence of valves. The other factors that aid venous drainage from the lower extremity towards the heart are negative intrathoracic pressure, the soleal pump(calf muscle) and the effect of arterial pulsation on the adjacent venae commitantes [9-11].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Aetiopathogenesis and Pathophysiology</h3>\r\n<p>The superficial veins, especially of the lower extremity become varicose, ie., dilated, tortuous and elongated in a period in some patients, which has been estimated to be 20% in men and 25-30% in women [6]. Aetiopathogenically, any cause in intravenous pressure, when sustained affects the cooptation of the valves. Such factors that lead sustained intravenous pressure are prolonged standing, intrabdominal mass(pregnancy, tumour), deep vein, obesity thrombosis and Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF). Others include congenital causes (Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Marfans&rsquo; syndrome), which lead to thinness of the vein wall and valves [12-15] (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/pic1.png\" width=\"444\" height=\"436\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> A: Prominent varicose veins involving the left great saphenous veins B: Healed ulcer, treated by skingrafting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pathophysiologically, the sustained pressure causes the tortousity, elongation and dilatation of the veins(varicose vejns) [16]. The varicose veins in the lower extremity lead to the following complications: Leg oedema -&gt; this occurs as a result increased hydrostatic pressure more than oncotic pressure at the venular end of the capillaries(Frank Starling&rsquo;s law of fluid dynamics in the capillaries) [17], stocking like discoloration/hyperpimentation -&gt; increased intravenous pressure leads to diapedesis and eventual haemosiderin deposition [18]; Ulceration -&gt; results from fibrin cuff theory or white blood cell activation theory [19], bleeding -&gt; from trauma, itching from elaboration of histamine, thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis -&gt; stasis according to Virchow&rsquo;s triad will cause thrombophlebitis in the superficial and venothrombosis in the deep veins respectively [20]. Other complications whose cause is not known is eczema and lipodermatosclerosis [21].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Symptomatology</h3>\r\n<p>Patients with varicose veins of the lower extremity present to the doctors on account of the complications such as cosmesis, swelling, hyperpigementary skin changes, ulceration, bleeding, deep vein thrombosis including acheing in the limb(s), eczema and itching [21]. Clinically, Tredelenburg test was used to elicit saphenofemoral incompetence, Pethes and Linton tests for deep vein thrombosis, Oshley-Maholy, Pratt and Fegan tests for eliciting perforator incompetences. Also, Schwartz test was used to confirm and differentiate varicose veins from heamngioma [22]. These tests are now no longer relevant because, the invention and application of doppler and duplex ultrasonography have revutionalized the diagnosis of varicose veins of the lower extremity alongside other pathologies like aneurysms and peripheral artery diseases [23] (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/pic2.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"301\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 2:</b> A: varicose ulcer on the distal 3 rd of the right leg and hyperpigmentary changes on both legs. Figure B: Varicose veins along the great saphenous veins on the left leg and hyperpigmentary changes on both legs.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Investigative Methodology</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Duplex Doppler ultrasonography is a simple, noninvasive, painless, readily available modality that can assess the anatomy and physiology of the lower extremity venous system. It can evaluate for acute and occult deep venous thrombosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, and incompetence of saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal junctions. It can also assess the reflux and diameter of the greater and lesser saphenous veins and the vascular architecture of the tributary and deeper perforating veins [24]. In our review, the sonologist must address the following concerns while assessing patients with lower limb varicose veins: competence or incompetence of SFJ, SPJ, the perforators and the presence or absence of deep vein thrombosis as well as presence or absence of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or fistula (AVF) [25]. Other less commonly used studies that may be helpful in select patients include venography, light reflex rheography, ambulatory venous pressure measurements, photoplethysmography, air plethysmography, and foot volumetry [24].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Treatment Modalities</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of varicose veins of the lower extremities is aimed at identifying the risk factors and the associated complications so that appropriate preventive and treatment strategies can be instituted including the varied but structured methods of managing the complications for the overall good outcome [25]. Treatment options for varicose veins include conservative management, external laser treatment, injection sclerotherapy, endovenous interventions, and surgery [24,26]. The indications for treatment are largely based on patient choice which in turn is affected by symptoms, cost, potential for iatrogenic complications, available medical resources, insurance reimbursement, and physician training, availability of equipment as well as the presence or absence of deep venous thrombosis and the characteristics of the affected veins [27]. The symptoms of varicose veins needing treatment are but not limited to aching pain, leg fatigue, ankle edema, chronic venous insufficiency, cosmetic concerns, early hyperpigmentation, external bleeding, progressive or painful ulcer, or superficial thrombophlebitis [28].</p>\r\n<p>Treatment modalities are divided into conservative and non-conservative. The non-conservative modalities are further subdivided into pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic/surgery. The conservative treatment is encompassed in the acronym &lsquo;BEEM&rsquo; as expounded by Bisgaard (Bisgaard regime): bandaging, elevation, exercise and massage [24,25]. Other measures not included in the Bisgaard regime are avoidance of risk factors such as prolonged standing, wearing restrictive clothing, constipation and modification of cardiovascular risk factors (oral contraceptive in the female gender) as well as medical therapy(diuretics, butcher&rsquo;s broom, horse chest nut extract) [24,25,29,30]. In the non-conservative management, novel modes of treatment are technologically driven and they include radiofrequency ablation, endovenous laser treatment and endovenous laser ablation especially for telangiectasias [31]. These methods of treatment are not currently available in developing countries [25] but their advantages are that it can be done on outpatient basis, it is successful on long term maintenance of vein closure and has shorter recovery period with fewer complications(paraethesiae and recanalization with improved quality of life and less expense on the subject [32,33]. In injection sclerotherapy, the aim is to inject substance(s) into the superficial veins that cause the sealing and scarring of the veins. Such substances include sodium tretradecyl sulphate, 3% saline (hypertonic saline) and corrosive agents like glycerin. The diameter of the veins indicated for therapy is 1 to 5mm. Associated complications are deep vein thrombosis and recurrence [24,34,35]. Surgery, historically, is considered the gold standard of treatment when there is combination of high ligation, division and stripping and multiple stab avulsion [36,37]. Surgical treatment depends on the outcome of doppler/duplex ultrasound report. Invariably, treatment may be single or a combination as described below: flush ligation at the saphenofemoral junction(Tredelenburg operation), subfascial(Dodd &amp; Cockett operation), multiple ligations, saphenopopliteal ligation and venous stripping. When there is venous ulcer, the plastic surgery unit takes over the management for possible skin grafting or flap cover.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Complications of Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Superficial site infection(SSI), wound haematoma femoral artery injury and or femoral vein injury, including neuritis, deep vein thrombosis and or Pulmonary embolism are the complications that are known to occur after treatment [38] especially by way of surgery.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Follow Up Strategies</h3>\r\n<p>Recurrence is a common phenomenon following treatment of varicose veins in spite treatment modality employed. Thus, patient should initially be followed up in vascular clinic, initially in 2-3 weekly to 2 - 3 monthly intervals. Thereafter, patient is referred to family physician(s) for follow up on prolonged basis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>In view of the fact that though, varicose veins alongside the complications are now treated noninvasively and invasively but recurrence still do occur, the understanding of the disease is still questionable and therefore open for continued research, so that a time will come when medical and or surgical therapy will cure the disease once diagnosed.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist target=\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299432655_Venous_hemodynamic_changes_in_lower_limb_venous_disease_The_UIP_consensus_according_to_scientific_evidence\">Bradbury AW (2009) Venous Physiology.

Methods: Sera samples were obtained from 20 patients with insulinoma and 20 normal controls. Differentially expressed proteins were screened by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis. In addition, serum and tissue samples were obtained from 22 and 18 insulinoma patients, respectively, and from 20 normal controls each. Serum concentrations of Cga and chromogranin B (Cgb) were assessed by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay and tissue expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Protein mass spectrometry identified 243 differentially expressed proteins, including 181 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated in insulinoma samples. Cgb concentrations were significantly higher in insulinoma than in control sera (75.02&plusmn;14.56 vs. 66.14&plusmn;10.55 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05), whereas Cga concentrations were not (90.26&plusmn;13.24 vs. 86.99&plusmn;7.58 ng/ml, P&gt;0.05). A Cgb cut-off of 65.76 ng/ml was diagnostic of insulinoma, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.714, a sensitivity of 0.818, and a specificity of 0.6. IHC-determined Cga and Cgb levels were both significantly higher in insulinoma than in normal samples (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Cgb is a suitable serological and IHC diagnostic marker of insulinoma, whereas Cga is suitable only for IHC.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Insulinoma;	Diagnostic	marker; Chromogranin A; Chromogranin B</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">&nbsp;Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Insulinoma, although rare, is the most common type of functional neuroendocrine tumor, with an annual incidence of about four patients per million in the general population [1]. About 90% of insulinomas are single, benign and &lt; 2 cm in diameter, with most of these lesions located in the pancreas and evenly distributed throughout the head, body and tail of the pancreas [2]. The etiology and pathogenesis of insulinoma remain unclear. Its clinical manifestations are related to the inappropriate secretion of insulin by tumor cells, with the primary manifestation being hypoglycemia [3]. In addition to being the most frequent cause of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients [3], insulinoma can cause other, serious metabolic disorders that may be life- threatening, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Insulinomas can be diagnosed by both qualitative and localized methods. The most commonly used method of qualitative diagnosis is the 72-hour starvation test, which induces hypoglycemia. Blood glucose &lt; 40 mg/dL ( &lt; 2.22 mmol/L), insulin &ge; 6.0 @U/ml ( &ge; 36 pmol/L), C-peptide &ge; 200 pmol/L, and proinsulin &ge; 5.0 pmol/L at the end of this 72 - hour period are regarded as indicative of insulinoma [4]. However, negative findings on this starvation test cannot completely rule out insulinoma. Patients who experience repeated hypoglycemia can be assessed by repeating the 72- hour starvation test by other methods to avoid misdiagnosis [5]. Diagnosis by localization mainly depends on imaging examination, although, in general, the accuracy of imaging in the detection of insulinoma is not satisfactory [6-10]. Thus, at present, there are no accurate methods for the diagnosis of insulinoma.</p>\r\n<p>Chromogranin A (Cga), a diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumors [11-14], was also regarded a diagnostic marker for insulinoma. More recent studies, however, have found that serum Cga is not diagnostic for insulinoma, and that it may not be diagnostic for neuroendocrine tumors [15]. Chromogranin B (Cgb) is another member of the pheochromogranin family that may be a diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumors [16-18]. It is unclear, however, whether Cgb concentration is diagnostic for insulinoma. In this study, proteins differentially expressed by sera from patients with insulinoma and healthy controls were screened by protein mapping, and the roles of Cga and Cgb as potential diagnostic markers of insulinoma were further evaluated.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sample collection</h3>\r\n<p>Serum samples were collected from 22 patients who had been diagnosed with insulinoma at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January 2012 to September 2020, and from 20 age- and sex- matched healthy controls. Involved tissue sections of patients with insulinoma were obtained from gross specimens after surgical resection, with normal control tissue sections obtained from normal tissues adjacent to pancreatic cancers. The characteristics of the tissue sections were confirmed by two or more experienced pathologists. All patients with insulinoma were diagnosed by pathological examination of tissue specimens, including those obtained by surgical resection and endoscopic ultrasound fine needle biopsy. Patients were included if they had hypoglycemia with Whipple&rsquo;s triad symptoms and pathologically confirmed insulinoma. Patients were excluded if they had hypoglycemia due to causes other than insulinoma, or if clinical data were incomplete. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and Equipment</h3>\r\n<p>Cga and Cgb enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were from MEIMIAN, immunohistochemical (IHC) assay kits were from ZSGB-BIO; and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling kits were from AB SCIEX (Cat. No. 4390812). Liquid phase separation was performed on a Shimadzu LC-20AB liquid phase system (Shimadzu), with a liquid phase UltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectrometry was performed using a Q-Exactive HF X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<p>Protein screening by iTRAQ proteomic analysis Serum samples were obtained from 20 patients with insulinoma and 20 age- and sex-matched normal controls. The 20 samples in each group were randomly assorted into four sets of five samples each, and each set of five samples was pooled, yielding eight pooled samples. Highly abundant proteins were removed using a Proteominert kit, and proteins of low abundance were enzymatically hydrolyzed and desalinated, followed by separation by high performance liquid chromatography. These samples were collected and their concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein quantitative method. Peptide tags 113, 114, 115, and 116 were attached to the peptides from the patients with insulinoma, and peptide tags 117, 118, 119, and 121 were attached to the peptides from the normal control group, as described by the instructions provided by the iTRAQ labeling kit. A Shimadzu LC-20AD liquid phase system was used for liquid phase separation of the samples. The elution peak was monitored at 214 nm, with one component each collected every 3.15 min. twenty components were obtained by combining the chromatographic elution peak diagrams, which were then frozen and drained. The peptide samples were redissolved in mobile phase buffer and separated by UltiMate3000. These peptides were ionized using a nanoESI source and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry using the Q-Exactive HF X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The iTRAQ data were quantified using iquant software (MGI Tech), which integrates the Mascot Percolator algorithm [19]. First, a 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) was filtered out at the spectrum/peptide level (PSM level FDR &le;0.01) to obtain the 20 most for significant peptides differentially expressed in sera from insulinoma patients and controls [20].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Detection of Cga and Cgb by ELISA</h3>\r\n<p>Blood samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4@ and centrifuged within 2 hours at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants (sera) were carefully removed and stored in a cryogenic refrigerator at-80@. The concentrations of Cga and Cgb in the serum samples were measured by ELISA (MEIMIAN), according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">IHC detection of Cga and Cgb</h3>\r\n<p>Paraffin sections were obtained from the Department of Pathology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. The slices had been stored at 4ï­ and baked for 2-8 hours before use. The paraffin sections were treated with xylene and an ethanol series, followed by antigen retrieval in sodium citrate buffer. The sections were incubated with endogenous peroxidase blocker, washed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibody, diluted 1:400, at 37ï­ for 60 min. After washing with PBS, the tissue sections were incubated with appropriate dilutions of goat anti-mouse/ rabbit IgG polymer at room temperature for 20 min. The sections were incubated with fresh DAB chromogenic agent, followed by hematoxylin. Five high visual power fields (HE&times;100) on each tissue sample were randomly selected, observed and photographed. Integral optical density was measured using Image-Pro plus 6.0 image analysis software, and its average value was calculated.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Bioinformatics analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Proteins were defined as up- and down-regulated in insulinoma compared with control samples at relative protein abundances of &ge;1.2 and &le; 0.833, with P-values &le;0.05 as determined by t-tests. The identified differential expressed proteins were annotated by GO based on the DAVID and QuickGO databases, and their biological functions were analyzed. The function of each protein was also determined by KEGG enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database. Protein interaction analysis was based on the analysis of interactions between differentially expressed proteins identified in the String database, with the lowest PPI interaction score being 0.4 and R version 4.0.4 used for analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Statistical analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Normally distributed variables were expressed as mean &plusmn; standard deviation (SD) and compared in two groups by independent sample t-tests. Non-normally distributed data were expressed as median (quartile 1 to quartile 3) and compared in two groups by independent sample rank sum tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to demarcate the boundaries and evaluate the diagnostic value of the model, and areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were compared by normal Z tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS24.0 software, with P&le;0.05 considered statistically significant.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>Results of protein identification Proteins differentially expressed in the sera of patients with insulinoma and normal controls were identified by iTRAQ analysis. Of the 819 proteins identified, 243 were differentially expressed, included 181 that were up- regulated and 62 that were down-regulated in insulinoma samples relative to control samples (Figure 1, Table 1).</p>\r\n<p><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(2).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"562\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1:</b> Description of the 20 most up-regulated and 20 most-down regulated proteins in patients with insulinoma.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"248\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> Volcano map of differentially expressed proteins.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Bioinformatics analysis of data</h3>\r\n<p>Using the biofunctional analysis tool R, the 243 differentially expressed proteins were annotated with GO function (Figure 2). This analysis showed that the molecular functions of these proteins included hydrogen ion transmembrane transporter activity, protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity, and kinase inhibitor activity. These biological processes involve the G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle, cell cycle phase transition, and mitotic cell cycle phase transition. Cell components are mainly located in the cytoplasm. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed 15 significant pathways, including oocyte meiosis, renin secretion, and vascular smooth muscle contraction (Figure 3).

Cga concentrations, as detected by ELISA, did not differ significantly in patients with insulinoma and healthy controls (90.26 &plusmn; 13.24 ng/ml vs. 86.99 &plusmn; 7.58 ng/ml, P&gt;0.05); In contrast, Cgb concentrations were significantly higher in patients with insulinoma than in healthy controls (75.02 &plusmn; 14.56 ng/ml vs. 66.14 &plusmn; 10.55 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05). As determined by ELISA, the cut-off value of Cgb diagnostic of insulinoma was found to be 65.76 ng/ml. This concentration had an AUC of 0.714 (95% CI 0.554-0.873), a sensitivity of 0.818 and a specificity of 0.6 (Figure 5).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure5.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"246\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 5:</b> ROC curve diagram of Cgb expression.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Comparative expression of Cga and Cgb in tissue samples from insulinoma patients and normal controls based on IHC</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Using IPP software to measure the average IOD value of three fields in each section (Figure 6), we found that the average IOD for Cga was significantly higher in the insulinoma than in the control group (78198.5 [20139.3, 115478.5] vs. 1230.1 [343.0, 3337.8], P&lt; 0.05).

Although several serum markers have been used to diagnose neuroendocrine tumors, specific markers for the diagnosis of insulinoma remain lacking. The present study evaluated whether Cga and Cgb are diagnostic markers for insulinoma. Serum and tissue samples were obtained from patients with insulinoma and the concentrations of Cga and Cgb in these samples compared with normal serum and tissue by ELISA and IHC, respectively. The results showed that IHC-determined Cga content in tissue samples was diagnostic of insulinoma, whereas serum Cga concentration was not. In contrast Cgb in both tissue and serum was diagnostic of insulinoma.</p>\r\n<p>Although serum Cga concentrations were slightly higher in patients with insulinoma than in healthy controls, this difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, serum Cgb concentrations were significantly higher in insulinoma patients than in controls, and both Cga and Cgb were significantly higher in insulinoma tissue samples than in normal pancreatic tissue. Cga A, originally found in chromaffin granules secreted by adrenal medulla chromaffin cells, is an acidic soluble glycoprotein [21] that belongs to the granule protein family is widely expressed in the endocrine, neuroendocrine, and peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as in other tissues. Cells secrete Cga into the circulation by exocytosis [22]. Endocrine, neuroendocrine and neuroendocrine differentiated tumor cells release Cga into the blood, resulting in the concentration of Cga being higher in these patients than in healthy controls and making Cga an auxiliary diagnostic marker for these tumors [23- 27]. A retrospective study involving 270 patients showed that Cga had a sensitivity of 84.2%, a specificity of 78.2%, and a negative predictive value of 96.5% in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors [25]. The levels of expression of Cga were found to be higher in sera and paraffin sections of non-&beta;-cell than of &beta;-cell neuroendocrine tumors, with the content of Cga being directly associated with tumor size [28]. Although the serum concentration of Cga was only slightly higher in 57 patients with insulinoma than in 86 healthy controls, Cga concentration was significantly associated with the relative content of non-&beta; cell neuroendocrine tumor [15]. In addition, Cga was found to be closely related to the function of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells [29- 32]. Thus, the relatively low concentration of Cga in serum may be due to the small number of &beta;-cells that enter the blood by exocytosis.</p>\r\n<p>Like CgA, Cgb is a member of the chromaffin family [33]. This study found that the concentrations of Cgb in serum samples and paraffin sections were significantly higher in patients with insulinoma than in healthy controls, with IHC staining showed that Cgb was concentrated in islet cells, whereas Cga was not. These findings suggest that Cgb is more suitable than Cga as a diagnostic marker for insulinoma. Assays of Cgb with Cga concentrations in selected patients with neuroendocrine tumors and renal insufficiency and in patients taking PPI [18] showed that Cgb was as sensitive as Cga as a diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumors, with Cgb not affected by renal insufficiency or PPI drugs [17]. A study of neuroendocrine tumors in Japanese patients showed that Cga and Cgb, as determined by ELISA, were equally diagnostic of neuroendocrine tumors, but that Cgb had advantages in distinguishing among other pancreatic diseases [34]. The increased concentration of Cgb in the sera of patients with insulinoma may be due to its inhibition of insulin secretion by islet cells [35]. Knockdown of the Cgb gene in mice showed defective insulin secretion and regulation of early insulin granule transport by the Golgi apparatus in islet &beta; cells [36], with the latter being necessary for the effective transport of secretory proteins to budding granules [37]. Cgb plays an important role in insulin transport, which explains its increased expression in patients with insulinoma. Further study, however, is required to determine its detailed mechanisms of action.</p>\r\n<p>This study analyzed insulinomas in patients with neuroendocrine tumors, with the serum concentrations of Cga being similar to those previously reported [15, 28]. The present study found that Cga is not suitable as a serological marker for insulinoma, and that serum Cgb concentrations and IHC staining are greater in paraffin sections of patients with neuroendocrine tumors.</p>\r\n<p>This study had several limitations, including its sample size and its omission of patients with other types of neuroendocrine tumors, patients with renal insufficiency and patients taking PPI drugs. Additional studies, in larger numbers of patients and in patients with other conditions, are needed to determine the diagnostic effectiveness of Cga and Cgb.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, the present study assessed whether Cga and Cgb concentrations are diagnostic markers of insulinoma. This study found that Cgb is a more suitable a diagnostic marker than Cga, a finding that may help improve the diagnosis of insulinoma.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgments</h3>\r\n<p>The authors are grateful for support from the Department of Gastroenterology of The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University.

The pandemic has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy. Even though substantial progress in clinical research has led to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the management of COVID-19, limiting the continuing spread of this virus and its variants has become an issue of increasing concern, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to wreak havoc across the world, with many countries enduring a second or third wave of outbreaks of this viral illness attributed mainly due to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus. Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2, while adapting to their new human hosts, is prone to genetic evolution with the development of mutations over time, resulting in mutant variants that may have different characteristics than its ancestral strains. Several variants of SARS- CoV-2 have been described during the course of this pandemic, among which only a few are considered variants of concern (VOCs) by the WHO, given their impact on global public health. Based on the recent epidemiological update by the WHO, as of December 11, 2021, five SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>Alpha (B.1.1.7): first variant of concern described in the United Kingdom (UK) in late December 2020</li>\r\n    <li>Beta (B.1.351): first reported in South Africa in December 2020</li>\r\n    <li>Gamma(P.1): first reported in Brazil in early January 2021</li>\r\n    <li>Delta (B.1.617.2): first reported in India in December 2020</li>\r\n    <li>Omicron (B.1.1.529): first reported in South Africa in November 2021</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Etiology</h3>\r\n<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-stranded RNA(+ssRNA) viruseswithacrown-likeappearanceunderanelectronmicroscope (coronam is the Latin term for crown) due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the envelope. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) classifies into four genera of CoVs:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>Alphacoronavirus (alphaCoV)</li>\r\n    <li>Betacoronavirus (betaCoV)</li>\r\n    <li>Deltacoronavirus (deltaCoV)</li>\r\n    <li>Gammacoronavirus (gammaCoV)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>BetaCoV genus is further divided into five sub-genera or lineages [1]. Genomic characterization has shown that bats and rodents are the probable gene sources of alpha CoVs and beta CoVs. On the contrary, avian species seem to represent the gene sources of delta CoVs and gamma CoVs. CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. Members of this large family of viruses can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in different animal species, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) capable of infecting humans have been identified. Some of the HCoVs were identified in the mid-1960s, while others were only detected in the new millennium. In general, estimates suggest that 2% of the population are healthy carriers of a CoVs and that these viruses are responsible for about 5% to 10% of acute respiratory infections [2].</p>\r\n<p>Common human CoVs: HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 (betaCoVs of the A lineage); HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 (alphaCoVs). These viruses can cause common colds and self- limiting upper respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent individuals. However, in immunocompromised subjects and the elderly, lower respiratory tract infections can occur due to these viruses. Other human CoVs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (betaCoVs of the B and C lineage, respectively). These viruses are considered to be more virulent and capable of causing epidemics manifesting with respiratory and extra-respiratory manifestations of variable clinical severity.</p>\r\n<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betaCoV belonging to the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which havebeen previously implicated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics with mortality rates up to 10% and 35%, respectively [3]. It has a round or elliptic and often pleomorphic form and a diameter of approximately 60&ndash;140 nm. Like other CoVs, it is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. In this regard, although high temperature decreases the replication of any species of virus. Currently, the inactivation temperature of SARS-CoV-2 is being researched. A stainless-steel surface held at an air temperature of 54.5&deg;C (130 &deg;F) results in the inactivation of 90% of SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 36 minutes. At 54.5&deg;C, the time for a 90% decrease in infectivity was 35.4 &plusmn; 9.0 min and the virus half-life was 10.8 &plusmn; 3.0 min.[4] Conversely, it may resist lower temperatures even below 0&deg;C. Also, these viruses can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents, including ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, and chloroform except for chlorhexidine.</p>\r\n<p>Genomic characterization of the new HCoV, isolated from a cluster-patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan, had 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. Hence, it was termed SARS- CoV-2 by experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The single-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains 29891 nucleotides, encoding for 9860 amino acids.</p>\r\n<p>Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown, it is widely postulated to have originated from an animal implicating zoonotic transmission. Genomic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from a strain found in bats. The genomic comparison between the human SARS-CoV-2 sequence and known animal coronaviruses indeed revealed high homology (96%) between the SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoV RaTG13 of bats (Rhinolophus affinis) [5]. Similar to SARS and MERS, it has been hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 advanced from bats to intermediate hosts such as pangolins and minks, and then to humans.[6]. A recently released report by the WHO describing the possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive as it did not clearly specify the origin of the virus; however, it did report that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 occurred as early as December 2019. This report explored several possible hypotheses of the origin of the virus that included the origin of the virus in an animal, the transmission of the virus to an intermediate host, and subsequent passage into humans.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">SARS-CoV-2 Variants</h3>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to genetic evolution resulting in multiple variants that may have different characteristics compared to its ancestral strains. Periodic genomic sequencing of viral samples is of fundamental importance, especially in a global pandemic setting, as it helps detect any new genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the genetic evolution was minimal initially with the emergence of the globally dominant D614G variant, which was associated with increased transmissibility but without the ability to cause severe illness. Another variant was identified in humans, attributed to transmission from infected farmed mink in Denmark, which was not associated with increased transmissibility [7]. Since then, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been described, of which a few are considered variants of concern (VOCs) due to their potential to cause enhanced transmissibility or virulence, reduction in neutralization by antibodies obtained through natural infection or vaccination, the ability to evade detection, or a decrease in therapeutics or vaccination effectiveness. With the continued emergence of multiple variants, the CDC and the WHO have independently established a classification system for distinguishing the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 into variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs)</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Alpha (B.1.1.7 lineage)</h3>\r\n<p>In late December 2020, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, B.1.1.7 lineage, also referred to as Alpha variant or GRY(formerly GR/501Y.V1), was reported in the UK based on whole-genome sequencing of samples from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [8]. In addition to being detected by genomic sequencing, the B.1.1.7 variant was identified in a frequently used commercial assay characterized by the absence of the S gene (S-gene target failure, SGTF) PCR samples. The B.1.1.7 variant includes 17 mutations in the viral genome. Of these, eight mutations (&Delta;69-70 deletion, &Delta;144 deletion, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) are in the spike (S) protein. N501Y shows an increased affinity of the spike protein toACE 2 receptors, enhancing the viral attachment and subsequent entry into host cells [9]. This variant of concern was circulating in the UK as early as September 2020 and was based on various model projections. It was reported to be 43% to 82% more transmissible, surpassing preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2 to emerge as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK [10]. An initial matched case-control study reported no significant difference in the risk of hospitalization or associated mortality with the B.1.1.7 lineage variant compared to other existing variants. However, subsequent studies have since reported that people infected with B.1.1.7 lineage variant had increased severity of disease compared to people infected with other circulating forms of virus variants [11]. A large matched cohort study performed in the UK reported that the mortality hazard ratio of patients infected with B.1.1.7 lineage variant was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04, P &lt; 0.0001) patients with previously circulating strains.[12] Another study reported that the B 1.1.7 variant was associated with increased mortality compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants (HR= 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.82) [13]. The risk of death was reportedly greater (adjusted hazard ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.09) among individuals with confirmed B.1.1.7 variant of concern compared with individuals with non-1.1.7 SARS- CoV-2 [14].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Beta (B.1.351 lineage)</h3>\r\n<p>Another variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 also referred to as Beta variant or GH501Y.V2 with multiple spike mutations, resulted in the second wave of COVID-19 infections, was first detected in South Africa in October 2020 [15]. The B.1.351 variant includes nine mutations (L18F, D80A, D215G, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, and A701V) in the spike protein, of which three mutations (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) are located in the RBD and increase the binding affinity for the ACE receptors [16]. SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2(B.1. ccc xccssion and reduced neutralization by monoclonal antibody therapy, convalescent sera, and post-vaccination sera [17].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Gamma (P.1 lineage)</h3>\r\n<p>The third variant of concern, the P.1 variant also known as Gamma variant or GR/501Y.V3, was identified in December 2020 in Brazil and was first detected in the US in January 2021. The B.1.1.28 variant harbors ten mutations in the spike protein (L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, H655Y, T1027I V1176, K417T, E484K, and N501Y). Three mutations (L18F, K417N, E484K) are located in the RBD, similar to the B.1.351 variant [17]. Notably, this variant may have reduced neutralization by monoclonal antibody therapies, convalescent sera, and post-vaccination sera [18].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage)</h3>\r\n<p>The fourth variant of concern, B.1.617.2 also referred to as the Delta variant was initially identified in December 2020 in India and was responsible for the deadly second wave of COVID-19 infections in April 2021 in India. In the United States, this variant was first detected in March 2021. The Delta variant was initially considered a variant of interest. However, this variant rapidly spread around the world prompting the WHO to classify it as a VOC in May 2021. The B.1.617.2 variant harbors ten mutations ( T19R, (G142D*), 156del, 157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N) in the spike protein.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Omicron (B.1.1.529 lineage)</h3>\r\n<p>The fifth variant of concern B.1.1.529, also designated as the Omicron variant by the WHO was first identified in South Africa on 23 November 2021 after an uptick in the number of cases of COVID-19 [19]. Omicron was quickly recognized as a VOC due to more than 30 changes to the spike protein of the virus along with the sharp rise in the number of cases observed in South Africa. The reported mutations include T91 in the envelope, P13L, E31del, R32del, S33del, R203K, G204R in the nucleocapsid protein, D3G, Q19E, A63T in the matrix, N211del/L212I, Y145del, Y144del, Y143del, G142D, T95I, V70del, H69del, A67V in the N-terminal domain of the spike, Y505H, N501Y, Q498R, G496S, Q493R, E484A, T478K, S477N, G446S, N440K, K417N, S375F, S373P, S371L, G339D in the receptor-binding domain of the spike, D796Y in the fusion peptide of the spike, L981F, N969K, Q954H in the heptad repeat 1 of the spike as well as multiple other mutations in the non-structural proteins and spike protein [19].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOIs)</h3>\r\n<p>VOIs are defined as variants with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes that may cause enhanced transmissibility or virulence, reduction in neutralization by antibodies obtained through natural infection or vaccination, the ability to evade detection, or a decrease in the effectiveness of therapeutics or vaccination.So far since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO has described eight variants of interest (VOIs), namely Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429); Zeta (P.2); Eta (B.1.525); Theta (P.3); Iota (B.1.526); Kappa(B.1.617.1); Lambda(C.37) and Mu (B.1.621).</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429) variants, also called CAL.20C/ L452R, emerged in the US around June 2020 and increased from 0% to &gt;50% of sequenced cases from September 1, 2020, to January 29, 2021, exhibiting an 18.6-24% increase in transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains. These variants harbor specific mutations (B.1.427: L452R, D614G; B.1.429: S13I, W152C, L452R, D614G). Due to its increased transmissibility, the CDC classified this strain as a variant of concern in the US.

This variant is classified as a VOI by the WHO and the CDC due to its potential reduction in neutralization by antibody treatments and vaccine sera.</li>\r\n    <li>Eta (B.1.525) and Iota (B.1.526) variants harbor key spike mutations (B.1.525: A67V, &Delta;69/70, &Delta;144, E484K, D614G, Q677H, F888L; B.1.526: (L5F*), T95I, D253G, (S477N*), (E484K*), D614G, (A701V*)) and were first detected in New York in November 2020 and classified as a variant of interest by CDC and the WHO due to their potential reduction in neutralization by antibody treatments and vaccine sera.</li>\r\n    <li>Theta (P.3) variant, also called GR/1092K.V1 carry key spike mutations (141-143 deletion E484K; N501Y; and P681H) and was first detected in the Philippines and Japan in February 2021 and is classified as a variant of interest by the WHO.</li>\r\n    <li>Kappa (B.1.617.1) variant harbor key mutations ((T95I), G142D, E154K, L452R, E484Q, D614G, P681R, and Q1071H) and was first detected in India in December 2021 and is classified as a variant of interest by the WHO and the CDC.</li>\r\n    <li>Lambda (C.37) variant was first detected in Peru and has been designated as a VOI by the WHO in June 2021 due to a heightened presence of this variant in the South American region.</li>\r\n    <li>Mu (B.1.621) variant was identified in Columbia and was designated as a VOI by the WHO in August 2021.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The CDC has designated the Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429) variants as a VOC and Eta(B.1.525); Iota (B.1.526); Kappa(B.1.617.1); Zeta (P.2); Mu(B.1.621,B.1.621.1) and B.1.617.3 as VOIs.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Transmission of SARS-CoV-2</h3>\r\n<p>The primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via exposure to respiratory droplets carrying the infectious virus from close contact or droplet transmission from presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic individuals harboring the virus. Airborne transmission with aerosol- generating procedures has also been implicated in the spread of COVID-19. However, data implicating airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of aerosol- generating procedures are emerging and being evaluated. However, this mode of transmission has not been universally acknowledged. Fomite transmission from contamination of inanimate surfaces with SARS-CoV-2 has been well characterized based on many studies reporting the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on various porous and nonporous surfaces. Under experimental conditions, SARS-CoV-2 was noted to be stable on stainless steel and plastic surfaces compared to copper and cardboard surfaces, with the viable virus being detected up to 72 hours after inoculating the surfaces with the virus [20].</p>\r\n<p>Viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 degrees C from nonporous surfaces such as glass, stainless steel. Conversely, recovery of SARS-CoV-2 on porous materials was reduced compared with nonporous surfaces. A study evaluating the duration of the viability of the virus on objects and surfaces showed that SARS-CoV-2 can be found on plastic and stainless steel for up to 2-3 days, cardboard for up to 1 day, copper for up to 4 hours. Moreover, it seems that contamination was higher in intensive care units (ICUs) than in general wards, and SARS-CoV-2 can be found on floors, computer mice, trash cans, and sickbed handrails as well as in the air up to 4 meters from patients implicating nosocomial transmission as well in addition to fomite transmission [20].</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released an update stating that individuals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via contact with surfaces contaminated by the virus, but the risk is low and is not the main route of transmission of this virus.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Epidemiology</h3>\r\n<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence of viral diseases represents a serious public health risk. In the past two decades, several epidemics caused by viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV) in 2012 have been described which have had a significant impact on global health. Since being declared a global pandemic by the WHO, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 has spread to 223 countries with more than 281 million cases, and more than 5.4 million deaths reported globally. A recent epidemiological update by WHO, reported that more than 200 countries around the world have reported SARS-Co-V-2 variants of concern of which the newer VOC, Omicron has been reported by 76 countries so far since first being reported in November 2021. The U.S. has experienced the highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 related deaths followed by Brazil and India. In fact, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020 after heart disease and cancer, with approximately 375,000 death reported [21]. The WHO&rsquo;s current estimate of the global case fatality rate for COVID-19 is 2.2%. However, the case fatality rate is affected by factors that include age, underlying preexisting conditions, and severity of illness and significantly varies between countries.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Age, Gender-based Differences and The Impact of Medical Comorbidities in COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>Individuals of all ages are at risk of contracting this infection and severe disease. However, patients aged &ge;60 years and patients with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients) have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the CDC during January 22 to May 30, 2020. Notably, the study also reported that the percentage of patients who succumbed to this illness was 12 times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (19.5% vs. 1.6%). Data regarding the gender- based differences in COVID-19 suggests that male patients are at risk of developing severe illness and increased mortality due to COVID-19 compared to female patients. Results from a retrospective cohort study from March 1 to November 21, 2020, evaluating the mortality rate in 209 US acute care hospitals that included 42 604 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported a higher mortality rate in male patients (12.5%) compared to female patients (9.6%) [20].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pathophysiology</h3>\r\n<p>The general description of viral structure and its genome of CoVs is essential for addressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. As described earlier, CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid, and the genomic structure is organized in a +ssRNA of approximately 30 kb in length and with a 5&prime;-cap structure and 3&prime;-poly-A tail making it the largest among RNA viruses. Upon entry into the host, replication of the viral RNA is initiated with the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab). The transcription occurs through the replication- transcription complex (RCT) organized in double-membrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) sequences. Conversely, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between the so- called open reading frames (ORFs) that work as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs. In an atypical CoV genome, at least six ORFs can be present. Among these, a frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b guides the production of both pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro), as well as one or two papain-like proteases for producing 16 with known or predicted RNA synthesis and modification functions non-structural proteins (NSPs 1-16). Besides ORF1a and ORF1b, other ORFs encode structural proteins, including spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins and accessory proteic chains.[3]. Different CoVs possess unique structural and accessory proteins translated by dedicated sgRNAs. The pathogenesis of CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is related to the function of the NSPs and structural proteins. For example, researchers have outlined the role of NSPs in blocking the host&rsquo;s innate immune response. Among functions of structural proteins, the envelope has a crucial role in virus pathogenicity as it promotes viral assembly and release. Among the structural elements of CoVs, there are the spike glycoproteins composed of two subunits (S1 and S2). Homotrimers of S proteins compose the spikes on the viral surface, guiding the link to host receptors [22].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2</h3>\r\n<p>Structurally and phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is composed of four main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) protein, along with 16 nonstructural proteins, and 5-8 accessory proteins. The surface spike (S) glycoprotein, which resembles a crown, is located on the outer surface of the virion and undergoes cleavage into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit, which facilitates the incorporation of the virus into the host cell and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit containing a fusion peptide, a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain is responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion. The S1 subunit is further divided into a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), which facilitates viral entry into the host cell and serves as a potential target for neutralization in response to antisera or vaccines. The RBD is a fundamental peptide domain in the pathogenesis of infection as it represents a binding site for the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS), as previously hypothesized, does not increase the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and severe disease [22].</p>\r\n<p>SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the hosts&rsquo; cells by binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike or S protein (S1) to the ACE2 receptors abundantly on respiratory epithelium such as type II alveolar epithelial cells. Besides the respiratory epithelium, ACE2 receptors are also expressed by other organs such as the upper esophagus, enterocytes from the ileum, myocardial cells, proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and urothelial cells of the bladder. The viral attachment process is followed by priming the spike protein S2 subunit by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that facilitates cell entry and subsequent viral replication endocytosis with the assembly of virions [22].</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the spike RBD allows the binding to the ACE2 receptor in the lungs and other tissues. The spike protein of an amino acid site (polybasic site) allows the functional processing of the same by the human enzyme furin (protease). This process enables the exposure of the fusion sequences and, therefore, the fusion of the viral and cell membranes, a necessary passage for the virus to enter the cell.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Types of vaccines Messenger RNA</h3>\r\n<p>(mRNA) vaccines mRNA-based drugs are new but not unknown. In 1990, the direct injection of mRNA in mouse muscle cells proved the feasibility of mRNA vaccines. mRNA instability, high innate immunogenicity and delivery issues were the main obstacles. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were the first authorized mRNA-based vaccines. They contain the mRNA of the antigen of interest which enters cells and is translated into the spike protein to induce an immune response. Against the historical strain, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines had an efficacy of &gt;90% at 5e6 months&rsquo; follow-up post second dose, whereas CVnCoV had a lower efficacy of 48% [23,24].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Viral vector vaccines</h3>\r\n<p>Viral vectors are delivery systems containing nucleic acid encoding an antigen. AZD1222, Ad5-nCoV and Sputnik V had an efficacy of 65e91.6% against the historical strain. AZD1222 had an efficacy of 70.4 against Alpha. Ad26. COV2.S had an efficacy of 69.4% in Brazil (mainly P2). AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S had efficacies of 10.4% and 64.7%, respectively, against Beta in South Africa [23,25].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Inactivated and protein subunit vaccines</h3>\r\n<p>Inactivated vaccines are whole viruses that cannot infect cells and replicate. Subunit vaccines are made of fragments of proteins or polysaccharides. NVX-COV2373 had an efficacy of 89-91.6% against the historical strain, 86.3-93.2% against Alpha and 60% against Beta. CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, Wuhan inactivated vaccine, COVAX and Abdala had an efficacy of 50.6-92.3% but the SARS-CoV-2 strains were not specified. Kovac, Barekatn QazVac, RBD- Dimer, EpiVacCorona had no phase III trial data published at the time of this review. Real world studies [23,26].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection</h3>\r\n<p>After full immunization, effectiveness was 90-92% for AZD1222 and BNT162b2 against unspecified strains. For mRNA vaccines, effectiveness against infection was 89.5-99.2% against Alpha, 75-96.4% against Beta, 42-84.4% against Delta and 80-98.2% against unspecified strains. AZD1222 had an effectiveness of 49-67% in the UK. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines in the USA had an effectiveness of 47-80% against Delta . Among pregnant women, a single dose or two doses led to an effectiveness of 78% against the original strain and 96% against Alpha, respectively. These previous studies focused on 6 years in people, but a retrospective cohort of teenagers aged 12e15 years in Israel also reported a high effectiveness of 91.5% against Delta infections [27].</p>\r\n<p>Several studies have suggested that the levels of antibodies after BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines could last for at least 6 months but decrease over time thereafter. For mRNA-1273, at 6 months neutralizing activity was maintained against Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, whereas neutralizing activity was considerably decreased against Beta for half the participants. Observational studies stratified by time since vaccination identified a decreasing effectiveness at 4-6 months (42-57%) for mRNA vaccines and 47.3% for AZD1222 against Delta infection. In the USA, effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against symptomatic infection fell from 94.3% in June to 65.5% in July 2021. The effectiveness against hospitalization remained high (&gt;85%) for mRNA-1273 (92%), BNT162b2 (77-93%) and AZD-1222 (70.3%) at 4-6 months after full vaccination and 68% at &gt;28 days after full immunization for Ad26 COV2.S. It is difficult to know whether the reduction in effectiveness against Delta [28].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Extension of the dose interval</h3>\r\n<p>More generally, evidence on the extension of the interval between doses is scarce. Trials for AZD1222 showed that a longer delay was better, but for mRNA and other vaccines trials did not test different dose gaps. A preprint reported that extending the interval to 6 weeks for BNT162b2 vaccine led to higher titers in neutralizing antibodies and a sustained T-cell response against the variants of concern. Another analysis found that a second dose at 12 weeks induced a stronger humoral response than at a 3- week interval among older people [27].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Vaccination of previously infected individuals</h3>\r\n<p>Several neutralization assays have suggested that a single dose of BNT16b or mRNA-1273 among previously infected subjects could boost the cross-neutralization response against emerging variants such as Alpha, Beta or Gamma. These studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of vaccinating both noninfected and previously infected people. Finally, several studies have suggested that a single dose of mRNA vaccine may be sufficient to boost the antibody response in previously infected subjects and that the benefit of the second dose may be small [25].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">A booster dose for specific populations</h3>\r\n<p>Immunogenicity studies amongst transplant patients and patients with cancer showed a poor antibody response after a single dose or two doses of Pfizer vaccine. Facing this issue, French, German, British and US health authorities have recommended a third dose for immunocompromised people and transplant recipients. A randomized trial in transplant recipients showed that a third dose of mRNA- 1273 was safe, and 26 out of 59 participants who had negative antibody responses prior to the booster developed antibody responses after the third dose. However, this study did not look at the cellular immune response. Another study found that an additional dose of mRNA-1273 induced a serological response among 50% of kidney transplant recipients who hadn&rsquo;t responded after two doses. A case control study in preprint found an effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection 14e20 days after the third dose increased by 79% (versus the second dose). Another observational study in Israel found that a booster dose reduced the rate of confirmed infections and severe disease by a factor of 11.3 and 19.5, respectively, among elderly participants. Two studies also showed that Moderna boosters (at least 6 months after the second dose) and Pfizer booster (8-11 months after the second dose) induced a strong humoral response against Beta and other variants of concern. The expected local and systemic adverse events were mild and moderate and like those after the second dose [28].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Treatment &amp; Management of Covid- 19</h3>\r\n<p><b>General care</b></p>\r\n<p>Rest in bed, strengthen supportive treatment, adequate caloric intake, pay attention to water and electrolyte balance, and maintain internal environment stability. At the same time, close follow-up should be conducted to observe patients&rsquo; respiration, monitor blood oxygen saturation, and observe changes in body temperature. Attention should be paid to those patients who have changed from mild to severe or critical, especially the elderly, obese, patients with diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, COPD, etc. According to the conditions, blood routine, urine routine,c- reactiveprotein, biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, cardiac enzyme, renal function, etc.), and coagulation function should be monitored when necessary, as well as arterial blood gas analysis and chest imaging being performed if required [29].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Antivirals</h3>\r\n<p>The bottom line is to treat the cause of disease. For COVID-19, antiviral therapy isa top priority, in both mild and severe cases. Without treatment and intervention for its cause, other treatments are very passive [29].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Oseltamivir</h3>\r\n<p>Oseltamivir was a first-line antiviral drug, especially in primary hospitals. During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most patients with COVID-19 who are symptomatic have used oseltamivir. Considering its popular and important role as an antiviral drug, it was necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19  [30].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Structure &amp; IUPAC name</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(1).png\" width=\"290\" height=\"168\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ethyl(3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetamido-3-(pentan-3-yloxy)- cyclohex-1-ene-1carboxylate</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Dose</h3>\r\n<p>75g orally twice a day for 5 days.</p>\r\n<p>Latest studies recommend against use of oseltamivir in COVID- 19 [30- 32].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Mechanism of Action</h3>\r\n<p>Oseltamivir is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to active form oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor serving as a competitive inhibitor towards sialic acidfound on the surface proteins of normal host cells. By blocking the activity of the viral neuraminidase (NA)enzyme, oseltamivir prevents new viral particles from being released by infected cells [31].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Synthesis</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(1).png\" width=\"695\" height=\"496\" /></p>\r\n<p>synthesis developed by Gilead Sciences starting from naturally occurring quinic acid or shikimic acid.

The commercial software Mimics is used to segment and reconstruct the geometric model of the lower limbs from Chinese female bone computed tomography images. Then, bone cuts are made according to the surgical steps of implanting a fixed bearing unicompartmental arthroplasty using 3-matic software. Four combinations of two pin holes created for tibial cutting guide placement are simulated with finite element analysis software ABAQUS under standing postures load case. The stress distribution and maximum von Mises stress on the tibial plateau is evaluated. Pin hole placed close to the medial edge of the proximal tibial plateau is associated with the highest stress and is more likely to result in medial tibial fracture. On the contrary, pinhole placed along the central axis near the tibial tuberosity has the lowest stress and reflects lower risk of fracture. The present study revealed that placing tibial cutting guide holding pins centrally would lower the risks of periprosthetic fracture of the medial tibial plateau by analyzing the associated stress in various pin hole positions using finite element analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Biomechanics; Finite element analysis; Knee; Pin hole for guiding and cutting; Tibial platea; Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Unicomparative Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) is   one   of the successful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Knee osteoarthritis. The goal of UKA is to relieve pain and restore the function of the knee joint by replacing the diseased area with artificial implants. The most common type of UKA is medial UKA, because of the high prevalence of medial osteoarthritis [1,2]. UKA is applied to patients with unilateral compartment diseases. UKA only performs surface replacement for the worn parts of the knee joint to replace the damaged cartilage surfaces of the femoral and tibial joints in the knee joint, and UKA has a very high success rate [3,4] and high medium-to long-term survival rate [5]. Compared with total knee replacement, unicondylar replacement has the following advantages: The exposed area of surgical invasion is small, and the cruciate ligament and most of the tibia are preserved, thus reducing the risk of postoperative complications [6-9]. The UKA technology is very mature, but it faces a small probability of serious complications [10,11], namely, postoperative periprosthetic fractures, which will lead to inconvenience for patients to move. In severe cases, reoperation is required and the reoperation will be more difficult. The specific manifestation of this complication is the stress fracture of the medial tibial plateau under the UKA tibial prosthesis, which will lead to the loosening of the tibial floor and the collapse of the tibial plateau as the condition deteriorates [12]. Normally, after UKA, the patient was allowed to walk with immediate weight bearing for early recovery. Therefore, the structural stability of the UKA implant and the surrounding bone is essential for the early recovery of the patient. It is very important to avoid periprosthetic fractures. According to research reports, varus more than 6 with the coronal plane or any tibial valgus can significantly increase the risk of medial compartment fractures [13]. In addition, low bone density in the proximal tibia and multiple holes in the proximal tibia during placement of the tibial cutting guide also increase the risk of fracture [14,15]. In order to reduce the risk of fracture, each brand of UKA manufacturers currently recommend the two-pin hole drilling scheme for guide positioning. However, according to the operation technical document of UKA manufacturers, there is still a chance of fracture using only the two-pin scheme [16,17]. It is currently unclear how the difference in the location distribution of these holes affects the development of tibial fracture, and there is still no definitive study on how to determine the location of the two-pin method for UKA guide positioning and drilling, and how to ensure the optimal mechanical properties of the tibial plateau after drilling. In recent decades, with the rapid development of powerful computing power of computers, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been increasingly used in the orthopedic field to simulate the mechanical properties of orthopedic implants under different conditions, optimize the design of orthopedic prostheses, surgical planning, orthopedic biomaterials, and orthopedic biomechanical research. FEA has become an important research method in orthopedic biomechanics due to its simple operation, data reliability, and parametric modeling [18,23]. In this study, the FEA technique was used to investigate the effect of different perforation locations on the stress distribution of the tibial plateau after UKA surgery and to analyze the risks of periprosthetic fractures with different tibial guide pin locations.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Subjects and Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Establishment of finite element analysis model</h3>\r\n<p>In this study, the workflow we used is shown in Figure 1. First, the three-dimensional geometric model of the lower limb needs to be obtained from the segmentation and three-dimensional reconstruction of CT data of the lower limb. At the same time, the UKA prosthesis model needs to be obtained through Computer Aided Design, CAD). Then the lower limb geometric model and the prosthesis geometric model were imported into the forward engineering software 3-Matic of CAD (Materialise, Belgium) for editing, and the geometric model after UKA was obtained. Finally, the finite element analysis software was used to establish the mesh model for finite element analysis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(3).png\" width=\"349\" height=\"176\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> The workflow of FEA.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Three-Dimensional Geometric Model of Tibia</h3>\r\n<p>In this study, a three-dimensional model was established using CT images of the tibial region of a volunteer without any anatomical abnormalities in the lower extremity. The CT layers were 1.25mm thick and each layer was 512&times;512 pixels in size. We used the medical image segmentation software Mimics (Material, Belgium) to threshold segment the CT data, erase the pixels except the region of the lower limb, and then use the Region growing function to segment the Mask of the region where the tibia and femur are located, and finally use the Calculate 3D function to calculate the 3D geometric model of the tibia. To distinguish the cortical bone from the trabecular bone structure, we shifted the 3D geometric model of the tibia inward by 2mm to generate the trabecular bone structure, and then used the Boolean operation to generate the 3D geometric model of the cortical bone structure by subtracting the trabecular bone geometry from the 3D geometric model of the tibia. Finally, a 3D geometric model containing cortical bone and trabecular bone was obtained, as shown in Figure 2A. The green geometry was of cortical bone structure, and the dark blue geometry was of trabecular bone structure. The center of the knee joint was defined as the vertex of the intercondylar fossa of the femoral joint surface, and the center of the hip joint was defined as the central point of the femoral head using the Mose circle method. The center of the ankle joint was defined as the midpoint of the width of the talus [24]. The force line is defined as the connecting line connecting the center of the hip joint and the center of the ankle joint, as shown in Figure 3A, where the red dotted line is the force line. The medial single- chamber knee prosthesis was redesigned by the CAD software Solidworks (dassault systemes, USA) using a reverse engineering approach, as shown in Figure 2B. It was assembled on the medial tibia according to the surgical requirements described in ZUK&rsquo;s Surgical Technical Manual (Zimmer, USA). Cement fixation was simulated by inserting a 2.0mm thick layer of bone cement, Polymethyl Methacrylic (PMMA), between the cutting surface of the tibia and the bottom of the tibia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(2).png\" width=\"502\" height=\"185\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 2: A:</b> Geometric model of the tibial plateau and UKA prosthesis (<b>Figure A</b> is a geometric model of the tibial plateau after cutting; <b>B:</b> is a UKA implant prosthesis; <b>C:</b> is the geometric model after UKA).

The use of two combinations of punch and horizontal translation of the cutting guide produces four pin configuration models, the schematic of which is shown in Figure 4. In modes 1 (Figure 4A) and 2 (Figure 4B), the tibial guide is aligned with the sagittal plane. Modes 3 (Figure. 4C) and 4 (Figure 4D) are established by moving the proximal portion of the cutting guide laterally horizontally to align with the tibial force line (i. e ., using M/L at the axis of the assembly) while maintaining a lateral cut perpendicular to the force line.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure4(2).png\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 4:</b> Four different drilling patterns (pattern 1 in Figure A, two holes against the sagittal tibial cutting plane; Figure B shows pattern 2 with one hole against the sagittal tibial cutting plane and the other hole against the edge of the tibial plateau, near the medial aspect of the tibia; Figure C shows mode 3 with the two holes against the force line; Figure D shows pattern 4 with one hole against the force line and the other centrally located in the transverse tibial incision).

Four types of two pin-holes</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Finite Element Model Establishment</h3>\r\n<p>In Abaqus software (dassault systemes, USA), because the surface of the tibial geometry is irregular, we use tetrahedral mesh to divide the tibial model. The mesh size is 3mm, and about 784000 tetrahedrons are produced. The finally produced mesh model is shown in Figure 5. According to the material properties of the literature [25], the young&rsquo;s modulus of the polyethylene liner, titanium alloy tibial plateau, and bone cement layer were 0.65 GPa, 110.6 GPa, and 2.65 GPa, with poisson&rsquo;s ratios of 0.46, 0.33, and 0.46, respectively. The Young&rsquo;s modulus of cortical and trabecular bone is defined as 0.83 GPa and 13.4 GPa with a poisson&rsquo;s ratio of 0.3. The load was applied as a 1000 N load down the force line (shown in Figure 3A) on the surface of the polyethylene liner to simulate a 68 kg body weight patient standing. A binding constraint was established between the polyethylene liner and the titanium alloy tibial plateau, and contact was established between the tibial plateau and the bone cement, and between the bone cement and the trabecular bone. A common node constraint is establish between that trabecular bone and the cortical bone.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure5(2).png\" width=\"175\" height=\"172\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 5:</b> The mesh of tibial FEA model.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Finite Element Solution</h3>\r\n<p>The model analysis mode is set as a static model.

Solvers were run on ThinkPad P15 mobile workstation and each model was solved in approximately 15 minutes.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Result</h3>\r\n<p>In order to study the effect of perforation location on stress distribution of tibial plateau after UKA operation, we used the von- Mises stress results of finite element analysis. When processing von-Mises stress analysis, we used the default post-processing parameters of results in Abaqus software, and in the Average element output at nodes option, and set the Averaging threshold to 75%. We analyzed the stress magnitude, the distribution of the stress cloud picture and the stress concentration on the tibial model. As shown in Figure 6, the stress nephogram of the four modes shows that the distribution shapes of stress iso-surface are known, and the high-stress area is shown in the Figure. The yellowish area of the stress nephogram is concentrated on the left side of the sagittal cutting plane, and the stress in the high-stress area remains at the level of 7MPa, which is far lower than the yield strength of cortical bone material [26] (take the research data of 50-year-old women for example, the yield strength value is about 140MPa). However, in the case of mode 2, stress concentration occurred in the distal hole and the value remained high, as shown in Figure 7, reaching 29MPa. It was also unevenly distribute over that circumference of the hole near the tibial edge and concentrate in the lower left region of the hole. With reference to the other three modes in Figure 6, the stress in the circumferential region of all the holes is basically in the range of 2-7MPa. The stress concentration near the hole in mode 2 is about 4 times of the stress peak around the hole in the other three modes. In the four models, the sagittal plane cutting plane edge stress is the largest. In mode 2, a high stress area was distributed around the sagittal incision. The maximum von-Mises stress appears in the mode 2 hole. Von-Mises stress is the lowest in mode 3 hole. In the four modes, von-Mises stress tends to increase and the stress is more concentrated when the hole position is away from the force line. The von-Mises stress ends to decrease and the stress distribution area is uniform when the hole position is closer to the center position. Under the four modes, the maximum von-Mises stress of the tibia was about 30MPa except for Mode 2, and the maximum stress in Mode 2 reached 60MPa, which was about twice the value of the other three models. A higher stress means a lower safety factor. In mode 2, the stress is highly concentrated and maintained at a high level.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure6(2).png\" width=\"412\" height=\"231\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 6:</b> Stress nephogram of tibia after UKA operation in four punching modes, The stress distribution on tibial.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure7(1).png\" width=\"423\" height=\"236\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 7:</b> Stress nephogram of area near hole in case of mode 2, The stress distribution on tibial with mode two</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Significance of finite element analysis for drilling of UKA implant</h3>\r\n<p>The structural stability of the UKA implant and the surrounding bone is essential for the early recovery of the patient. In this study, the von-Mises stress distribution on the tibial surface due to different combinations of perforations generated during the placement of the tibial cutting guide was evaluated by finite element analysis. Analysis result indicate that placing that punch position closer to the tibial force line results in a decrease in proximal tibial pressure as compared to place it closer to the medial aspect of the tibia or below the sagittal tibial cutting plane. The incidence of periprosthetic fractures of the tibial plateau reported in the literature ranges from 0% to 10% [27,28]. Periprosthetic fractures of the medial tibial plateau below the tibial floor are a very serious complication after the UKA. Early non-displaced stress fractures can be treated conservatively with either protective weight-bearing or screw fixation. However, displaced fractures accompanied by loosening of the implanted prosthesis require revision of total knee arthroplasty, and acute fractures require medial support plate fixation [9]. After the repair surgery, the patient also needs to install protective supporting instruments to restore the walking function of the patient. Therefore, once the fracture situation is sent after UKA surgery, we face the greater invasive surgical treatment brought by reoperation, which brings more bone tissue cutting or anatomical tissue destruction, thus prolonging the patient&rsquo;s rehabilitation device and bringing some potential complications such as infection. So this goes against the original intent of the UKA  procedure. At present, most UKA-related finite element analysis studies have focused on the fracture risk associated with the tibial tray. Some researchers have proposed that valgus or varus of any tibial component above 6 in any tibial component would increase the pressure on the proximal end of the medial tibia [13]. In order to avoid the interference caused by the varus/varus malposition in the finite element analysis model, we simulated the osteotomy in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the tibial force line.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Effect of UKA Punching Mode on Stress Distribution Around the Hole After Operation</h3>\r\n<p>In this study, we found that there are similar unique high- stress areas (yellow areas in Figure 6) on von-Mises stress diagrams in four modes. In this study, the high-stress areas develop along the medial tibia, and the sub-high-stress areas (areas between green and yellow in Figure 6) surround the high-stress areas. In this study, they are called stress peripheral zones. This phenomenon is consistent with the clinical cases of fracture after UKA [15]. The drilling position of the fixing pin of the tibial cutting guide rail is placed close to the medial area of tibia, as in the case of drilling mode 2, which will cause excessive stress concentration, which is much higher than that of other drilling modes. The hole at the far end of the punch hole in the model 4 shows the minimum stress, which is far away from the stress center zone and the peripheral zone; However, the proximal pinhole of Mode 4 is also in the central zone, so it is also related to the high stress value (Figure 6). In mode 3, the near-end and far-end drilling are far away from the central and peripheral zones, and the stress value is the smallest, which indicates that this is the safest drilling scheme. From the above analysis results, it can be concluded that each hole will cause the stress around the hole to rise, but the rising value is quite different, which is closely related to the distribution of the hole location. The farther the hole is from the central zone and the peripheral zone, the more uniform the stress distribution around the hole is, and the lower the stress peak value is. In this study, we found that there are similar unique high-stress areas (yellow areas in Figure 6) on von-Mises stress diagrams in four modes. In this study, the high-stress areas develop along the medial tibia, and the sub-high-stress areas (areas between green and yellow in Figure 6) surround the high-stress areas. In this study, they are called stress peripheral zones. This phenomenon is consistent with the clinical cases of fracture after UKA [15]. The drilling position of the fixing pin of the tibial cutting guide rail is placed close to the medial area of tibia, as in the case of drilling mode 2, which will cause excessive stress concentration, which is much higher than that of other drilling modes. The hole at the far end of the punch hole in the model 4 shows the minimum stress, which is far away from the stress center zone and the peripheral zone; However, the proximal pinhole of Mode 4 is also in the central zone, so it is also related to the high stress value (Figure 6). In mode 3, the near-end and far-end drilling are far away from the central and peripheral zones, and the stress value is the smallest, which indicates that this is the safest drilling scheme. From the above analysis results, it can be concluded that each hole will cause the stress around the hole to rise, but the rising value is quite different, which is closely related to the distribution of the hole location. The farther the hole is from the central zone and the peripheral zone, the more uniform the stress distribution around the hole is, and the lower the stress peak value is.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Effect of UKA Drilling Mode on the Peak Stress of Tibia After Operation</h3>\r\n<p>The peak stress of tibia after UKA is shown in Table 1. In four modes, the peak stress of tibia plateau appears at the intersection of transverse plane and sagittal plane, and the peak stress of intersection is closely related to the position of proximal hole. The only difference between mode 3 and mode 4 is the position of proximal hole. Mode 3 is located in the area close to the force line, and mode 3 is located in the center of the central belt. In this case, the peak stress of tibia plateau is the smallest, compared with mode 1 and mode 3. The proximal hole of Model 4 is located directly below the center of UKA prosthesis. In other modes, the proximal hole deviates from the center of the prosthesis. Therefore, the proximal hole located directly below the center of the prosthesis will reduce the von-Mises stress peak of the tibia, that is, relieve the stress concentration at the intersection of the transverse plane and the sagittal plane.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(3).png\" width=\"380\" height=\"118\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1:</b> The peak von-Mises stress on tibial with four kinds of pin hole.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Best Punching Method and Punching Guidance in UKA Surgery</h3>\r\n<p>In order to reduce the risk, the two-pin drilling method needs to fix the position of the distal hole in the area close to the force line. For example, the distal holes of Mode 3 and Mode 4 are located close to the force line. Model 4 is recommended for patients who need to introduce two punching laws. For patients with osteoporosis, you can choose to drill a distal hole near the force line first, and then cut it. Although it brings some problems of vibration in the cutting process, it is a safe attempt for patients with osteoporosis to avoid stress concentration caused by placing a hole in the central belt. Because of the nonlinear relationship between the fatigue life of bone materials and stress, smaller peak stress means longer fatigue life [29,30]. For patients with osteoporosis, the peak value To sum up, in UKA surgery, the drilling scheme of mode 4 is adopted, in which the hole near the distal end of the force line is drilled first, and in case of vibration, the hole near the center of the central belt is drilled.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Innovation and Deficiency</h3>\r\n<p>In this study, the largest drilling scheme was explored through finite element analysis, which provided a theoretical guidance for reducing the risk of fracture after UKA surgery. This study showed that a reasonable drilling method could reduce the maximum stress of the tibial plateau after surgery and make the stress distribution of the tibial plateau more uniform, thus reducing the medium and long-term bone tissue fatigue and further inducing the risk of fracture. The risk was lower than that of patients with osteoporosis, and it was very important to reduce the stress concentration and stress peak value of the tibial plateau. There are some limitations in this study. First, it was a preliminary finite element study to evaluate the stress distribution associated with different punch locations at the proximal tibia. The reconstructed model is based on a normal Chinese female tibial model, and its generalization to other races or genders is unknown. Second, we simulated the virtual tibial incision according to the design and description of ZUK&rsquo;s surgical technique. FEA may change if testing other brands of fixed bearing UKA or moving bearing UKA. Third, the stress values presented in this study were only used for comparison and risk assessment between the four modes. The correlation between stress values and actual material failure may require further verification by biomechanical testing. In the subsequent research, biomechanics of the corpse can be added as verification. The displacement during the loading process is monitored by an optical tracking system, such as NDI equipment, and the stress changes on the tibia and the surface of the prosthesis are recorded by using a membrane pressure sensor. The unique data and pressure data obtained can be used as reference for improving the finite element analysis model.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>In this study, the finite element analysis technology was used to simulate the four patterns of UKA drilling with two pins method, and the von-Mises stress distribution of the tibia was obtained. It was analyzed that drilling the distal hole close to the force line and the proximal hole near the center of the central band could reduce the peak stress of the tibia and make the stress distribution uniform, thus reducing the risk of postoperative fracture. UKA procedures should avoid proximal drilling near the medial edge of the tibia.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33221693/\" target=\"_blank\">	Ng JP, Fan JCH, Chau WW, Lau CM, Wan YC, et al.

OPLL is an entity typically seen in Asian races (Incidence 2.4%). It is utmost important to diagnose this condition because it can cause compression of spinal cord and in approximately 25% percent of cases cervical myelopathy also [2]. One of the commonest cause of OPLL in India is fluorosis. OPLL is more prevalent in males and in old age (6th decades). Patients are generally asymptomatic, or may have a history of radiculopathy or myelopathy [3]. The clinical picture of OPLL is determined by the severity of spinal canal compression. OPLL is more frequently observed in mid cervical spine and causes central cervical canal stenosis [1]. There are four types of OPLL described; (I) continuous, ossification of multiple vertebral segments and their intervening discs (II) segmental, multiple segments are affected but not extending beyond the adjacent disc level, disrupted ossification present(III) mixed, a combination of segmental and continuous types and (IV) focal ,including only one or two segments. The diagnosis of OPLL is frequently made on Computed Tomography (CT) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).Ossification manifests as increased density in CT images and is present posterior to the vertebral bodies, discs or both. On MR scan the ossification is seen as a low signal intensity band of varying thickness between the vertebral body and the dural sac on T1- and T2-weighted images. Increased T2 signal intensity in spinal cord may be observed in patients with cord compression which correspond to myelomalacia or edema. Conservative treatment is useful when neurological signs or symptoms, mainly neck or arm pain, are mild and there is no evidence of myelopathy. Surgery should be considered in patients with OPLL who have symptomatic myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy. Laminoplasty and laminectomy has very good rates of neurological improvement.</p>\r\n<p>A 60-year-old male patient came to our neurology OPD with complaints of progressive weakness in bilateral upper limbs and neck pain for last four months. There was no history of trauma. Patient belonged to fluorotic belt of state of Rajasthan of India. Neurological examination was performed which revealed grade 4 power in bilateral upper limbs. Patient was advised for MRI of cervical spine.MRIT1 weighted image (T1WI) and T2WI revealed thickened and calcified posterior longitudinal ligament from C1 to C6 vertebral levels causing significant spinal canal stenosis. There were generalized reduced signal intensities observed in the vertebral bodies which were consistent with the fluorosis. (Figure 1A and 1B).MRI Cervical spine T2WI also demonstrated large disc osteophyte complexes and thickened posterior longitudinal ligament from the C2 to C7 vertebral level causing compression of the cord (Figure 1C). After that CT scan of cervical spine was advised for pre-operative evaluation. CT scan of cervical spine in bone window nicely depicted the thickening and calcification of posterior longitudinal ligament (mixed type) along with the changes of fluorosis (Figure 1D).Patient underwent cervical laminectomy and had good recovery post-operatively.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Learning Points/Take Home Messages (2-3 Bullet Points)</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1.

A content of inguinal canal varies; usual contents are bowel and momentum. But it varies from liver, bladder, Merkel\'s diverticulum, uterus and fallopian tube. When the appendix is trapped within an inguinal hernia it defined as Amyand&rsquo;s hernia. It is rare form of inguinal hernia, which occurs up to 1% [1]. The appendix may inflamed or non-inflamed or incarcerated and incidence of appendicitis in Amyand\'s hernia only around 0.1%.Although the Amyand&rsquo;s hernia is rare, the appendix may become incarcerated within Amyand&rsquo;s hernia and lead to further complications such as mechanical obstruction, strangulation, necrosis, perforation and catastrophic peritonitis [2,3]. The appendix incarceration more commonly happens within inguinal and femoral hernias (De Garengeot&rsquo;s hernia) though it is unlikely to extend in the cases of incisional and umbilical hernias. It has been reported that incarcerated appendix in a variety of ventral abdominal and inguinal locations, however, there is a diagnostic challenge on its indistinct clinical presentation. The precise differential diagnosis is quite challenging for the treating clinicians due to the lack of different clinical signs and symptoms as well as the vague radiological diagnostic clinical features. For instance, incarcerated appendix is quite often misdiagnosed as a strangulated hernia [1]. The finding of Amyand&rsquo;s hernia occurs incidentally during surgery thus there is a lack of evidence-based optimal surgical management procedure. However, surgeons need to familiarize themselves with incarcerated appendixes within hernias in order to ensure potential successful surgical outcomes and avoid unexpected surgical complications. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide new insight into the diagnosis and treatment of Amyand&rsquo;s hernia and its complications.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Case Presentation</h3>\r\n<p>An 11-year-old boy presented with pain in the right groin region for 2 days. It was associated with mild fever, nausea and vomiting. Upon examination, a small lump in the right groin with inflammatory signs were noted. The records on investigations revealed that total WBC was 12, 60*10^9, C - reactive protein was 32 and an ultrasound image revealed that a small amount of free fluid was noticed in his right iliac fossa region, however, there wasn&rsquo;t an appendix visualized. Clinically it was manifested as appendicitis. Thus, laparoscopically appendectomy was performed during the procedure findings were a ruptured appendix into the right side inguinal canal and the appendix was seen through the deep inguinal ring and entered into the inguinal canal. Also, the ruptured tip of the appendix and adherence to the cord structures were noticed. This patient had undergone appendectomy carefully without causing damage to the cord structures (Figures 1 and 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(5).png\" width=\"565\" height=\"325\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> Inflamed appendix carefully delivered from the inguinal canal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(3).png\" width=\"563\" height=\"322\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 2:</b> After delivery appendectomy performed.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>The most recurrent incidents of Amyand&rsquo;s hernia accounted in men. Although the right side dominated significantly, also left side Amyand\'s hernias were reported, it is due to situs inverses, intestinal malrotation, or a mobile cecum [4] it is quite challenging for clinicians to arrive at a pre-operative clinical diagnosis through physical examination although it can be achieved by the abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography [5]. The latter reveals that a tubular blind-ended structure originated from the cecum wall and extends to the hernia sac while the former indicates a similar finding of a blind-ended non-compressible tubular structure with increased vascularity. However, there is a lack of evidence-based diagnostic value of sensitivity and specificity to this particular clinical entity [6]. In our case, the patient had no clinical or biochemical data of compromised bowel thus any radiological images were not ordered. A classification system, which was proposed by Losanoff and Bassonin 2007 [7], clarifies the advocated surgical treatment selections for different types of Amyand&rsquo;s hernias (Table 1). According to that, our patient was categorized as an Amyand type 1 hernia. Therefore no resection of the cecal appendix was performed and determined to be a micro pore prosthetic polypropylene mesh. A study recommends reducing the hernia content but not performing tension hernia repair [8]. If an appendectomy is performed, a clean surgery needs to be combined with a clean-contaminated surgery due to raising the infection rate [9]. Although in the cases of inflamed, supportive and perforated appendicitis no prosthetics material should be used as a result of the increased risk of surgical site infection and potential fistulae formation from the appendicular stump as well. In which cases an ice technique should be considered to ensure a lower recurrence rate in addition to appendectomy [10] while it depends on various factors including the surgeon&rsquo;s clinical decision, experience and domain over tension inguinal hernia repair techniques. However, existing new prosthetic materials like biological mesh influence the current surgical method in Amyand type 2 hernias as it suggests that the use of biological mesh prevents recurrence although there is a lack of literature to contend this hence future research needs to focus on its efficacy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<table class=\"MsoTableGrid\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;&#10;

Newer vaccines have been added to the initial six antigens that were available at the launch of Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974. Nigeria adopted a phased introduction of the pentavalent vaccine in 2012 and as part of the pre-introduction activities health workers&rsquo; knowledge on service delivery were refreshed by the training on the pentavalent vaccine.</p>\r\n<p><b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the effect of the pre-introduction training of pentavalent vaccine on immunization service delivery, focusing on health workers&rsquo; knowledge of service delivery by comparing the trained and untrained as well as other socio demographic characteristics.</p>\r\n<p><b> Methodology:</b> This was a cross-sectional comparative study involving 349 health workers from Edo state (n = 177) where the pentavalent vaccine training took place and Delta state (n = 172) where the training had not taken place at the time of the study. Data was collected using pre-validated questionnaires and analyzed using SPSS.</p>\r\n<p><b> Results:</b> There was a statistically significant difference in the knowledge score between the two states with 62.1% of Edo workers having good knowledge compared to Delta&rsquo;s 39% (p=0.00). A significant difference was also found in knowledge of trained versus untrained (p=0.00); level of education (with tertiary better than secondary) p=0.03; professional cadres (higher better than lower) p=0.02; years of work experience (p=0.02) but there was no significant association between supervised and unsupervised workers (p=0.16) nor health facility type (p=0.08).</p>\r\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b> The study showed that the training had positive influence on knowledge of health workers on service delivery and refresher trainings were recommended for the health workers to build their capacity.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Training;	Evaluation;	Knowledge; Immunization service delivery</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Immunization is a cost-effective strategy to minimize children disease and mortality [1]. Its public health efforts helped eliminate smallpox and polio in a few places [2]. It prevents debilitating illnesses and disability, and between two and three million child deaths are averted annually through vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles, and many more future deaths averted in older groups, e.g. 600,000 future deaths prevented annually through hepatitis B vaccination [2]. Vaccines guard against sickness by   raising   immunity.   Immunization   involves a functioning health system with a competent health professional that acknowledges the significance of vaccines, as well as robust infrastructure and logistical support [1]. Universal health coverage relies on the availability of a knowledgeable healthcare workforce and financial resources. Health professional competencies directly impact treatment quality [3]. The immunization system needs qualified and motivated personnel to manage new vaccinations [4]. Training is critical for health personnel participating in vaccination service delivery, particularly in the correct storage, handling, and administration of vaccines, as errors in any of these areas could result in catastrophic bad consequences following immunization. Increasing complexity of vaccination programs demands well-trained, qualified health professionals to provide the increased number of vaccinations to children whose numbers and age group are also growing [5]. Health professionals&rsquo; understanding of the new vaccine relies on how recently they were taught, their professional cadre, training quality, and involvement in immunization efforts [6]. Quality trainings, effective supervision, monitoring, and increased data management at the operational level are essential for the successful introduction of new vaccines in national immunization programs [7]. This study seeks to examine the impact of pentavalent vaccine pre-introduction training on health worker knowledge of vaccination service delivery and to determine if supervision and other socio- demographic variables affect their knowledge.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Design</h3>\r\n<p>This cross-sectional research compared health professionals&rsquo; vaccination knowledge before and after pre- introduction training. The design was selected because numerous outcomes and exposures may be evaluated simultaneously, making it rapid and straightforward to perform [8]. It contrasted skilled and untrained health professionals&rsquo; understanding of service delivery utilizing Edo State&rsquo;s pentavalent pre-introduction training. It also examined health professionals&rsquo; knowledge using participant variables in a positivist epistemological method where deductions are formed from obtained data [9]. Pre-validated questionnaires obtained quantitative data on immunization knowledge.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Setting</h3>\r\n<p>Nigeria has six Geopolitical zones. The two States for this study are located in the South-South Geopolitical Zone of Nigeria. The two selected states have similar economic and cultural history and the 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey shows similarity in the infant mortality rate and immunization coverage [10]. Both States made up the old Bendel State that was split in 1991 into two.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Edo State</h3>\r\n<p>Edo State has 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and is divided into three senatorial districts: North, South and Central. The total population of Edo State at the time of the study using the projection from the 2006 national census was 3,982,854 with an increase of 3.5% annually. Thus, the under one-year population of Edo State at 4% of the total population was 159,314, which is the target population for routine immunization. There were 549 health facilities rendering routine immunization services at the time the study was conducted. Of these, 111 were private health facilities; and 431 are public health facilities and 17 are secondary/tertiary health facilities.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Delta State</h3>\r\n<p>Delta State has three Senatorial zones: North, Central and South. There are 25 LGAs with Asaba as the state capital. It has a projected population of 5,372,917 with an under-one routine immunization target population of 210,917. Total numbers of health facilities were 908 while with 469 offering routine immunization.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Population</h3>\r\n<p>Participants of this study were selected health care workers responsible for vaccine administration in both Edo and Delta States. All the Local Government Areas in both States were involved in the study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Inclusion Criteria</h3>\r\n<p>All respondents were health workers involved in delivery of routine immunization services at the health facilities.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Exclusion Criteria</h3>\r\n<p>All Health workers not directly involved in the delivery of routine immunization services to the children were excluded from the study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sampling Approach</h3>\r\n<p>The list of health workers offering routine immunization services in both Edo and Delta states served as the sampling frame. In each of the LGA, the number of respondents was based on the number of health facilities rendering routine immunization services. A systematic random selection of health workers was done in all the LGAs of each state until the total number of health workers proposed in each state and LGA were exhausted. Systematic random sampling was used to ensure more even spread across the sample frame. A table of random numbers was used to select the first respondent in each LGA and the subsequent respondents were obtained using a calculated sampling interval derived by dividing the number of the immunization staff by the number of sample size required.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sample size</h3>\r\n<p>Due to lack of evidence, it was assumed that 50% of those health workers that are already involved in routine immunization service delivery should have good knowledge of immunization.</p>\r\n<p>In order to yield a representative sample for proportions, the Cochran&rsquo;s formula for calculating the estimate for categorical data was adopted [11]. The Cochran&rsquo;s sample size formula is: {n = (z2pq/d2)} where Z2 = desired confidence interval of 95%), P = estimated proportion of an attribute that is present in the population, q = 1 &ndash; p, d2 = desired level of precision.</p>\r\n<p>The Cochran&rsquo;s sample for the 2 States using n = 2 (z2pq/d2), with P = 0.50, q = 0.50, d = 0.1. n = 2(1.962 x 0.5 x 0.5/ 0.102) n = 2(3.8416 x 0.5x0.5/0.01) = 0.69148/0.01 = 192.08</p>\r\n<p>At an attrition rate of 10%, a sample size of 211 health workers per state was obtained. Edo had 549 facilities while Delta had 469 facilities. With an average of 2 health workers offering immunization services in each facility the total sample of health workers would be 1098 and 938 health worker in Edo and Delta respectively offering immunization services. Using a finite population correction method for the two states given by the formula {n = N*n/(N-)+n} where n = calculated sample size and N total number of sample population [12], for the two States, substituting N as 1098 and 938 for Edo and Delta respectively, it became</p>\r\n<p>n=1098*211/ (1098-1) +211	n=938*211/ (938-1) +211 n=231678/1308 n=197918/1148</p>\r\n<p>n = 177 (Edo State) n=172 (Delta State)</p>\r\n<p>So 177 health workers were selected in Edo and 172 health workers were selected in Delta. This was further broken down per LGA using the number of health facilities per LGA since health workers anticipated to have been trained in an LGA is proportional to the number of health facilities in that LGA, thus, an LGA such as Ethiope East in Delta State with 38 health workers involved in routine immunization services had 7 selected respondents based on the proportion of: {Number of health workers in the LGA &divide; Total number of health workers in the state} x Sample size required</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Instrument</h3>\r\n<p>The study instrument used for this study was a close-ended questionnaire. A questionnaire is cheaper, quicker to administer and avoids researcher&rsquo;s bias compared to focus group discussion and one on one interviews. It records privately the individual&rsquo;s response since it is looking at individual&rsquo;s knowledge [9,13]. The instrument, which was standardized for use was adapted from the validated WHO supportive supervision and new vaccine post introduction evaluation tool [14,15]. It was used because it is the available standard tool for measuring health workers&rsquo; knowledge and performance in immunization service delivery. It was adapted by excluding certain parts of the tool that required observations at work place. All questions in the questionnaire were related to immunization service delivery in general as related to the study topic. The service delivery questions were divided into 5 sections, representing the core areas of immunization service delivery; (A) Planning and schedules, (B) vaccines, supplies and cold chain management, (C) data management and monitoring for action (D) immunization safety, waste management and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and (E) communication. To avoid bias in responses, questions related to pentavalent vaccines were not included in the questionnaire.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pre-testing of study instrument</h3>\r\n<p>The questionnaires were pre-tested with 35 primary health care workers involved in immunization service delivery in a non-study LGA of Rivers State by the researcher. This was done as 30-50 questionnaires are used for pre-test in most studies [9,13]. The distributions of the pretesting health workers were; Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) (6), Community Health Officers (CHOs) (6), Nurses (5), midwives (4), Nurse/Midwives (6) and 8 public health nurses. The pre-test was done for consistency, clarity and relevance of the instrument. Ambiguous questions were discarded and the communication questions that were misunderstood were re-worded. Time allocated for completion of the questionnaire was determined from the pre-test.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Ethical Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>The International Online Research Ethics Committee at the University of Liverpool provided ethical permission, while the Commissioners for Health in Edo and Delta provided administrative approval. The researcher was only able to access the list of health personnel because they had been given permission to do so by the appropriate administrators. Before conducting the questionnaire, informed permission was obtained from the chosen health professionals, as required by the University of Liverpool&rsquo;s standards on consent for research investigations. All participants&rsquo; rights, privacy, and dignity were protected. Individuals may opt out of taking part at any time, and they weren&rsquo;t obliged to provide their names in order to take part; instead, they were assigned a unique identifier.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Data collection</h3>\r\n<p>The questionnaire administration and data collection was prepared using the schedule of days of the regular meeting of the immunization health workers gotten from the states. The student researcher gave the potential participants the participants&rsquo; information sheet to read and the opportunity to ask questions and reassured participants the information provided was anonymous. The consent forms were signed,   questionnaires   were   distributed and completed individually without consultations. The answered questionnaires were collected from the selected study participants same day by the student researcher.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Data Input</h3>\r\n<p>The data collected were counted per LGA for completeness and sorted into the respective states. In order to ensure that the data was of good quality, entry was conducted on Epi-Info 7.0 software with validation rules set in place from the design of the data entry template. Response rate for the study was 100% since the number of health workers that attend the monthly meeting outweighs the sample size per LGA. However, the few missing information (insignificant) were coded 99 in the analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Scoring methodology</h3>\r\n<p>Section A of the study instrument captured the demographic data such as; age, sex, level of education, cadre of health workers, training status and type, technical support received, years of experience, type of facilities and period of training of the health workers. The section B of the questionnaire, which ascertained the knowledge of the health workers, had 41 questions covering the immunization service delivery questions. Positive (Yes) responses or right answer to a question was scored with a one (1) while wrong answer was scored with a zero (0). A health worker is assumed to have a good knowledge on immunization service delivery if he/she scores 29 (=~ 70%) and above and poor knowledge if the scores is below 70% This score methodology was drawn from the 70% cut off point of the Likert scale of determining satisfactory index that was applied during the mid-level management (MLM) training on immunization in the African region [16] and also being used to evaluate training workshops in Nigeria.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>A total of 349 health workers were sampled from the two states. This meets the sample size calculated and there was a 100% response rate.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Socio-demographic information of respondents</h3>\r\n<p>Edo state that had pre-introduction training had 177 (50.7%) health workers sampled while Delta (yet to be trained, as at the time of the study) had 172 (49.3%) health workers. Females formed the majority of the respondents 331 (94.8%). A similar finding was seen in both states with Edo having 98.3% females and Delta 91.3%. Nearly half of the sample (165, 47.3%) were in the age group 26-35 years, followed by the 36-45 years 94 (26.9%) while the above 55 years group was least with just 3 (0.9%).</p>\r\n<p>Regards the level of education, 209 (59.9%) had tertiary education while 140 (40.1%) had secondary education. This was also found at State level though Delta State had more participants with secondary education (47.1%) compared to Edo state&rsquo;s 33.3%. In terms of technical qualification of the respondents, majority were either senior community extension health workers 113 (32.4%) or registered nurses/ midwives 123 (35.2%). Medical officers were only 3 (0.9%). State wise, the Edo state registered nurses/midwives 76 (42.93%) were higher than Delta state&rsquo; 47 (27.32%).</p>\r\n<p>On work experience and types of facility of the respondents, a third of the respondents had worked in their various facilities for a period of 1 &ndash; 5 years 109 (31.2%). Others were; between 6 &ndash; 10 years 70 (20.1%); 11 &ndash; 15 years 57 (16.3%); 21-25 years 20 (5.7%) and 26 &ndash; 30 years 21 (6.0%).</p>\r\n<p>Delta state had fewer respondents who worked less than a year 9 (5.2%) in their location when compared to Edo state&rsquo;s 16.9%.</p>\r\n<p>Majority 268 (76.8%) of respondents worked in primary health centers while those that worked in comprehensive model health centers and general hospital were in the minority, being just 8 (2.3%). In Delta state 138 (80.23%) a slightly higher proportion of the respondents worked in primary health centers compared to Edo state 130 (73.44%). Table 1 further illustrates that Edo state had more workers in primary health clinic, &minus; the smallest immunization unit &ndash; 22 (12.42%) than their Delta counterpart 7 (4.06%) Of the 349 respondents, majority 279 (79.9%) has had previous trainings on immunization service delivery. These trainings include the Reaching Every Ward (REW) (Nigeria&rsquo;s adaptation of the Reaching Every District training, vaccinology, Mid-Level Management training for immunization workers amongst others as well as the pentavalent vaccine pre- introduction training that had taken place only in Edo state at the time of this study. A higher proportion of participants, 150 (84.7%) were trained in Edo state while 129 (75%) were trained in Delta State as illustrated in table 1.</p>\r\n<p>Of the trained respondents, 108 (38.7%) had it on REW, 84 (30.1%) on the new pentavalent vaccine, 44 (15.7%) on vaccinology, 3 (1.07%) on MLM and 40 (14.3%) on other immunization trainings. It is worth noting that 16 of the respondents from Delta state had the pentavalent vaccine training in Edo state. On technical support received by respondents from their superiors, 139 (69.8%) received such support with both states sharing close similarity (Edo 67.2% and Delta 69.8%) as shown in table 1.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(5).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"598\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table01(1).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"318\" /></b></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1:</b> Socio - demographic characteristics of the respondents.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Knowledge scores of respondents</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">General Knowledge score of all Respondents</h3>\r\n<p>Table 2 summarizes the descriptive information about the knowledge scores of the respondents. The minimum knowledge score for all the respondents was 12.0 and the maximum was 41.0 with a mean of 29.04 and a standard deviation of 5.55. Using the 70% score as the cut off point for good knowledge on immunization service delivery [16] 197 (56.44%) respondents were found to have good knowledge with the minimum score being 70.73%. and the maximum 100%. 117 (66%) of Edo state respondents were found to have good knowledge on immunization service delivery against the 80 (34%) of the Delta State respondents with good knowledge.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table2(3).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"400\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 2:</b> Descriptive statistics of knowledge scores of respondents.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Mean Knowledge Score between Edo and Delta States</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The mean overall knowledge scores for Edo state and Delta state&rsquo; respondents was 30.61 and 27.42 respectively (Table 3). The Independent Samples t-Test showed a statistically significant difference in the mean overall knowledge scores between respondents from the two states with equal variances assumed among the population (t = 5.6, df = 347 and p value 0.00). There were statistically significant differences in the mean knowledge scores of the respondents from Edo and Delta states with equal variances assumed among the population in planning and schedules t = 5.12, df = 347 and p value 0.00; immunization safety waste management and adverse events following immunization t = 3.46, df = 347 and p value 0.00 and Communications t = 3.46, df = 347 and p value 0.00. Therefore, the overall knowledge of Edo state respondents was higher than those of Delta state.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table3(2).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"535\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* Denotes statistically significant finding at P value &lt; .0.05</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 3:</b> Group statistics and independent T test of knowledge between Edo and Delta states respondents.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Knowledge Scores of the Trained Respondents Based on the Type of Training Received</h3>\r\n<p>Using one-way analysis of variance, a statistically significant difference in the knowledge scores of the respondents based on the training type received was found (p value 0.03). The same statistical difference was observed in planning and schedules (p value 0.00), vaccine supply and cold chain management (p value 0.03) and immunization safety and waste management (p value 0.00). A further Post Hoc analysis using the Least Square Difference showed that for the overall knowledge score, there is difference between those that had vaccinology training and REW training (p = 0.00). The respondents that had the REW training and the new vaccines training had higher knowledge scores compared with those that had vaccinology, Mid-Level Management (MLM) and other forms of trainings with mean scores of 30.7 and 29.9 respectively higher than those of vaccinology and MLM (Table 4).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table4(1).png\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 4:</b> Descriptive Statistics and ANOVA of mean scores based on type of immunization training received by respondents.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Knowledge Scores of the Trained Respondents based on how recent they had their Trainings</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using ANOVA, a statistically significant difference in the knowledge scores (p = 0.00) between those trained within the last eleven months prior to the study to those trained earlier was found.

In addition, the study assessed how health professionals&rsquo; demographics influenced their familiarity with vaccination practices.</p>\r\n<p>From our study, we found that the proportion of the workforce in Edo state that had enough understanding of vaccination service delivery is greater than that of Delta state (Figure 1). Involvement of 45.3% of trained respondents from Edo state in recent training on the pentavalent new vaccination is likely to have considerably altered the knowledge base of the respondents, with the probable advantage of increased clarity in recall. Rowe et al found no significant association when community health workers&rsquo; recollection of training was used to evaluate their practice of health care, thus our findings may run counter to those [17]. However, it is worth noting that the quality of the training and the dedication of the participants are two aspects that might affect the success and effect of any educational endeavor.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(6).png\" width=\"630\" height=\"367\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> Knowledge score between Edo and Delta State Respondents.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On average, across the two states, almost 80% of responders received some kind of vaccination training. Similar results were found in the &ldquo;Reach Every District&rdquo; evaluation conducted in eight out of nine African nations (Nigeria was not included), where 75% or more of district health management professionals reported having received training on EPI in around one third of the districts [18]. A similar finding was reported in the 2008 REW evaluation in Nigeria, with 82% of health facility employees having received training [19].</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This study also shows that trained health professionals in the two states were more knowledgeable about service delivery than their untrained counterparts is consistent with those of earlier research where improvement in practice were observed after training such as better injection practices and surgical infection prevention protocols [20-25].</p>\r\n<p>This research also demonstrates that REW and trainings on new vaccinations had a greater impact on knowledge than the other types of trainings. This corroborates the research of [26], who showed that implementing district training of health professionals on the Reaching Every District led to an increase in vaccination coverage in 64% of 53 nations. Similarly, Otieno, 2012 evaluation of the impact of new vaccine training on knowledge and practice of vaccination service delivery provides similar report [27]. The current research found that respondents with training completed within 11 months of the survey had lower levels of knowledge than those with training completed from one year or more prior to the study. This result contradicts the findings of previous research, such as those by [6,28], which found that freshly educated individuals had a higher level of knowledge. Knowledge retention is influenced by a variety of variables, including but not limited to education level, individual aptitude, experience, and the quality of training, which may help to account for the current study&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>The current research demonstrated no statistically significant difference in vaccination service delivery expertise between health professionals with and without technical help, in the form of supportive supervision from superiors. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant knowledge gap between the two groups with respect to planning and scheduling. This finding contradicts Som, et al that found that supervised health care employees had more knowledge than their unsupervised colleagues [29].</p>\r\n<p>Since technical assistance tends to build on prior understanding, it&rsquo;s possible that it didn&rsquo;t play a role in the shift in understanding. Moreover, the information that was affected is a mirror of the understanding of the supervisor. This study found a statistically significant difference in the section assessing workers&rsquo; knowledge of planning and scheduling, which may be attributable to the fact that these topics are prioritized in the country&rsquo;s EPI programme objectives and are emphasized in each forum in which the topic is discussed [30].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>This study, which sought to demonstrate a connection between health workers&rsquo; knowledge and the pentavalent pre-introduction training they had received, as well as to determine if certain specific activities and socio-demographic characteristics of health workers had any relationship to their knowledge, highlighted the importance of quality training on knowledge of immunization service delivery and corroborated the findings in the aforementioned literature (6). The amount of supervision, however, is a crucial factor in how much they learn about immunizations, so training  alone is not enough. As a result, this research provides the rationale for refresher trainings of health workers and recommend REW, which focuses on supportive supervision as a means to enhance vaccination health workers&rsquo; expertise.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acknowledgments</h3>\r\n<p>We would like to sincerely thank my dissertation advisor, Linda Mason, for her guidance, encouragement and support throughout this dissertation process.

It is a histologic variant of DFSP and both are characterized by an intermediate grade of malignancy, local infiltrative growth, and high recurrence rate [1]. GCF occurs mostly in males during the first decade of life [2]. Radiological findings are non-specific, and the histological appearance showed pleomorphic giant cells with typical pseudovascular spaces [3]. Due to its rarity and painless character, the diagnosis of GCF is often mistaken or delayed, leading to giant forms with a high risk of relapse. Here we describe the clinic, radiologic and pathologic features of a voluminous GCF at the left gluteal region occurring in a two and half -year-old child who underwent a wide excision.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Case Report</h3>\r\n<p>A 2 and half -year-old female child with no personal or familiar history, presented to our hospital with a giant painless mass of the left gluteal region noted at 5 months of age. The patient&rsquo;s parents reported that the lesion had grown proportionately with her and protruded into the skin surface over time, becoming a voluminous mass. This lesion was previously examined with ultrasonography outside the hospital. It has been diagnosed as a hemangioma and treated with beta blockers without any improvement. Physical examination revealed an about 20 cm red-purple mass at the left gluteal region, with lobular margins, compressible touch, prominent blood vessels, and ulcerative areas at the surface [Figure 1]. There was no evidence of regional lymphadenopathy. A rectal exam performed under general anesthesia doesn&rsquo;t show an intraluminal involvement by the mass. A computed tomography (CT) was performed to delineate the tumor. It revealed a well-defined superficial mass of the left gluteal region, infiltrating adjacent subcutaneous adipose tissue and measuring 22x17x57mm. On unenhanced scan, the mass was homogenous and isodense without calcification. Contrast enhanced CT images showed marked peripheral enhancement in both arterial and portal venous phases [Figure 2]. No muscular invasion was observed. No lymphadenopathy or distant metastases were found. For the final diagnosis, the patient underwent a surgical excision.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(7).png\" width=\"234\" height=\"250\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1:</b> Protuberant red-purple mass of the left gluteal region with prominent blood vessels and ulcerative area at surface.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(4).png\" width=\"350\" height=\"328\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 2:</b> computed tomographic findings of the mass.

However, there was a narrow surgical margin at the medial side, due to the presence of a partial infiltration of the external anal sphincter requiring a small excision and reparation of the anus. Deeply, the fascia and a portion of the left gluteal muscle were also removed. A rotation advancement flap from the right gluteal region was used to repair the primary defect. Pathological examination revealed a soft and white mass measuring 8x6x5 cm with fasciculate containing on sectioning.</p>\r\n<p>Microscopically, the mass showed wavy fascicles of spindle and stellate cell tumor admixed with multinucleated giant cells within a hypocellular and moderately myxoid stroma, infiltrating the dermal and hypodermal layers.

It is considered as a histological variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and occurs mostly in males younger than 10 years of age [2,3]. GCF and DFSP are both fibroblastic tumors previously considered in tumors of the skin and actually removed in soft-tissue sarcomas in the revised 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Soft- Tissue Sarcomas [4]. Both lesions share common clinical, immunohistochemically, and molecular abnormalities. They are characterized by an intermediate grade of malignancy, local infiltrative growth with high recurrence rate, positive staining for CD34, and the presence of translocation t (17; 22) (q22; q13) that leads to a specific fusion of the platelet- derived growth factor beta (PDGF beta) with the collagen type 1alpha1 (COL1alpha1) gene [5]. GCF Metastasis has never been reported.</p>\r\n<p>This lesion can occur on any part of the body with a predilection for the back and thigh. Other less common sites include the anterior chest, shoulder, perineum, and extremities [2,3]. In our case, the tumor was located in the left gluteal region, which is a critical site for surgical management.</p>\r\n<p>Like DFSP, GCF appears primarily as a painless skin- colored (violaceous or bluish erythematous), indurated or atrophic plaque. Later, the plaque develops confluent nodules which gradually enlarge to form a protuberant mass of varying size. Generally, this slow growing process takes several months or years to as long as 60 years, and then complications such as bleeding, ulceration, and pain may arise. GCF is often superficial infiltrating dermal and subcutaneous tissue. In advanced stages, it may invade deep structures such as the fascia, muscle, periosteum, or bone [5].</p>\r\n<p>In infancy, GCF is often mis or underdiagnosed at an early stage and may be confused with other lesions such as vascular tumors, leading to delayed treatment. The little girl in this case had a protuberant painless mass of the left gluteal region with ulcerative areas and enlarged blood vessels at the surface, previously misdiagnosed as a hemangioma. Imaging studies are helpful in preoperative assessment and follow for recurrence.</p>\r\n<p>They may delineate the tumor&rsquo;s size and extent, and define its relationship with adjacent neuromuscular structures and bone. However, there are a little report describing the imaging findings of GCF in the pathologic literature [1, 2, 5, 6].</p>\r\n<p>GCF has nonspecific imaging findings. On ultrasound, the tumor often appeared as a low echogenic mass with a rich blood supply. Computed tomography (CT) showed a well-defined superficial nodule or mass isodense without calcification on unenhanced images , with homogeneous or inhomogeneous moderate to marked enhancement[5, 6].</p>\r\n<p>MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of GCF, which generally showed low signal intensity compared to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images, and intermediate to high signal intensity on T2- weighted images. On contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression, the tumor demonstrated moderate to marked contrast enhancement [1, 6].</p>\r\n<p>In a recent report, Min and Al observed a marked peripheral enhancement of GCF on MRI, and related that to hypercellularity with abundant vascular channels and myxoid component of the peripheral portion of the mass visible on pathologic examination.</p>\r\n<p>This intense peripheral enhancement of the mass is also remarkable on CT images in our case. That may confirm a consistent contrast behavior of the tumor on both plain CT/MRI scans, and support the suggestion of Min and al that there is different degree of cellularity and histological components between center and periphery of the mass.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, pathologists should mention the degree of cellularity between the center and the periphery of GCF, and further radio-histologic correlation studies are needed to highlight the imaging findings of GCF.</p>\r\n<p>The histogenesis of giant cell fibroblastoma has been a topic of considerable debate amongst researchers. Ultra structural studies have, however, demonstrated fibroblastic differentiation [7].</p>\r\n<p>Grossly, GCF appears as an unencapsulated, gray- white, gelatinous lesion. It ranges from 1 to 8 cm in dimension with a mean of 3&ndash;4 cm [3, 7].</p>\r\n<p>Microscopically, it shows a diffuse infiltration of the mid-and lower dermis with spindle cells and multinucleate giant cells arranged diffusely or in vague fascicles within a fibromyxoid to hyalinized stroma. The spindle cells have elongated nuclei with vesicular to hyperchromatic chromatin. The cytoplasm is usually scanty and eosinophilic. The giant cells contain a variable number of round to oval vesicular nuclei and have abundant amphophilic cytoplasm with irregular cytoplasmic contours. The degree of cellularity varies from hypocellular with abundant myxoid stroma to moderately cellular with less myxoid material. Giant cells line gaping and branching slit like sinusoidal spaces exclusively seen in GCF and that seem to reflect a loss of cell cohesion [7,8].</p>\r\n<p>Vimentin is the only immunohistochemical detection marker that has been found to consistently stain GCF [8]. In this case, typical pathologic findings and positive staining for vimentin were very suggestive for GCF.</p>\r\n<p>GCF and DFSP stained both positive for CD4 but negative for other immunohistochemical markers such as keratin, S-100 protein, HMB-45, smooth muscle actin, and desmin. Furthermore, they present unique cytogenetic features, such as the reciprocal translocation t (17; 22) or more commonly supernumerary ring chromosomes containing sequences from chromosomes 17 and 22 [5,8]. Hybrid lesions, with features of both DFSP and giant-cell fibroblastoma, have also been reported.</p>\r\n<p>Differential diagnosis includes three main lesions: DFSP, hemangioma and epidermal inclusion cysts. DFSC had nonspecific imaging findings, however, the presence of pseudovascular spaces lined by giant cells and vimentin marker favors the diagnosis of GCF.</p>\r\n<p>Hemangioma often occurs in the limb muscles and is a painless soft tissue mass, which shows calcification on CT, low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with dots or lines of low signal, which signifies calcification or venous stones, and slowly marked enhancement. Epidermal inclusion cysts can be easily distinguished from GCF because it shows no contrast enhancement on imaging studies.</p>\r\n<p>Surgical resection is the main treatment for GCF and the most significant prognostic factor is proven to be the extent of resection. Adequacy of surgical excision remains central to minimize disease recurrence. One large case series reported a local recurrence rate of approximately 50% [9]. The recommended surgical options include wide local excision (WLE) with clear margins and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).</p>\r\n<p>The direct compromise for WLE is tumor-free margins, however, adequate margins have not been defined according to rigorous clinical trials. NCCN guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) (version 1.2020) suggest 2&ndash;4 cm lateral margins of the tumor and the excision of the investing fascia to remove any infiltrating tumor in WLE. This procedure is generally applied for primary GCFs on the trunk or extremities. It allows immediate wound repair following tumor removal and it is cost effective for patients and medical resources. However, it is unable to evaluate surgical margins during the operation and exposed to high rate of local recurrence if negative margins were not obtained [5, 9].</p>\r\n<p>Mohs micrographic surgery is a stepwise procedure of tumor removal permitting a meticulous microscopic evaluation of the margins during excision. This is the ideal technique for GCFs in cosmetically and functionally sensitive regions including vulva, penis, scrotum, breast, peri-anal region, and inguinal fossa, and it is also recommended for recurrent lesions [5, 9].</p>\r\n<p>Local recurrence rate after MMS is significantly lower than WLE. Despite all these advantages. Mohs surgery has been performed in few reports because it needs specialized training of surgeons, high coordination with histopathologists, and intensive cost.</p>\r\n<p>Following tumor resection, Soft-tissue defect may be primarily closed, especially in regions with redundant soft tissue such as chest, abdomen, and back or reconstructed by using local or free fasciocutaneous flap or split-thickness skin grafting.</p>\r\n<p>In our case, the little girl underwent a wide excision with narrow margins at the internal side to preserve anus function and the defect was reconstructed with a flap rotated from the right gluteal region.</p>\r\n<p>Long-term outcome of GCF is very good especially after MMS, however, regular follow-up should be continued to detect disease recurrence [9].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>GCF remains a diagnostic challenge due to its rarity and similarities with other lesions such as DFSP and vascular tumors. However, clinicians should adopt a high index of suspicion in case of superficial soft tissue mass in children under the age of 5 years. On imaging studies, peripheral contrast enhancement may presume a preoperative diagnosis of GCF; therefore, the final diagnosis consists of typical pathologic features and immunohistochemical staining.</p>\r\n<p>The delay in diagnosis leads to the considerable growth of the lesion requiring extensive surgery and subsequently a large scars to be reconstructed. In cosmetic and functional regions, Mohs surgery is the ideal technique to preserve sparing tissue and to minimize the rate of local recurrence.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1.

Palliative care is comprehensive care aimed at providing the necessary health care to patients with incurable diseases. A palliative approach is a completely holistic approach to another person, one of whom is a health professional and the other a patient. Palliative care interventions are aimed primarily at reducing suffering and pain, which improves the quality of life of patients. The nurse is responsible for planning, conducting and evaluating health care with continuous assessment, educating patients and families, and collaborating with other members of the interdisciplinary team.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Palliative care; Patient; Nurse; Hospice</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Palliative care is an important a part of the every-day work of most health care professionals, whether or not they work in the hospital or community setting [1]. The word &lsquo;palliative&rsquo; originates from the Latin pallium, a cloak. In palliative care, symptoms are &lsquo;cloaked&rsquo; with treatments whose primary aim is to promote comfort. The more modern definition within the Oxford mini-dictionary may prove easier to understand: reducing bad effects. However, what is palliative care? The recognized World Health Organization definition describes palliative care as &lsquo;the active total care of patients whose disease isn&rsquo;t responsive to curative treatment&rsquo;. Palliative care is considered, in most definitions, to include the physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of care and is orientated to patients who have a non-curative condition. Palliative care should not be confused with terminal care, as many patients have palliative care needs from the time of their diagnosis and need ongoing palliative care for many months or years. The aim of palliative care is to help patients and their families through the physical and emotional traumas of life-threatening illness and to support them in this journey. Palliative care is not limited to cancer or perhaps to the terminal stages of illness; it can last for years, and may be applied to any life-threatening disease, though it is most frequently related to cancer. Palliative care is not an alternative to other care, but could be a complementary and essential component of total patient care.</p>\r\n<p>Nurses have particular concerns about telecare practices [2]. The first is that telecare will upset their relationship with patients. The second concern is that telecare will stop nurses noticing signs of trouble in time since they are no longer seeing their patients at home or within the clinic. The worst consequence would be that patients suffer needlessly.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Psychomotor Skills</h3>\r\n<p>Psychomotor skills are integral to nursing practice, and any deficiency in these skills among new graduates often ends up in criticism of nursing teaching programs [3]. Psychomotor skills enable nurses to perform effectively in action situations that need neuromuscular coordination. These skills are purposeful, complex, movement-oriented activities that involve an overt physical response. The term skill refers to the flexibility to hold out physical movements efficiently and effectively, with speed and accuracy. Therefore, psychomotor skill is over the capability to perform; it includes the ability to perform proficiently, smoothly, and consistently, under varying conditions and within appropriate limits. Psychomotor skill learning requires practice with feedback to refine the performance until the required outcome is achieved. Thus, clinical learning activities should include plentiful opportunities for practice of psychomotor skills with knowledge of results to facilitate the skill-learning process.</p>\r\n<p>However, psychomotor skill development involves over technical proficiency. While performing technical skills, nursing students and staff members must also perform caring behaviours, critical thinking, and clinical   reasoning,   problem   solving, and deciding. However, the flexibility to integrate all of those competencies directly usually isn&rsquo;t achieved until the technical skill component is so well developed that it now not requires the nurse&rsquo;s or nursing student&rsquo;s conscious attention for successful performance. It is only at now that the learner sees the full picture and is ready to focus on the patient as well because the technical skill performance.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Delivery of Care</h3>\r\n<p>Professional bodies have a profound effect on the work of the individual practitioner and influence work practices normally [4]. Although this influence is at its most intense for registered practitioners, those training for the professions must be fully conscious of the demands of their professional codes or rules of conduct. Because the registering bodies produce the codes and rules, infringement of the professional codes may end in deregistration of the practitioner, with consequent loss of status and earnings. The relationship of codes and rules of conduct to the law is considered, together with their significance for the expected professional behaviour of the practitioner.</p>\r\n<p>Nurses may form the most important number of health care professionals within the delivery of care, but not all care is that the province of nursing. Increasingly, the vital input made by other health care professionals, both in hospital and within the community, may be a great a part of the treatment and rehabilitation of the client. Thus, as codes and rules of conduct are important, so is that the smooth working of the multidisciplinary team in health care.</p>\r\n<p>Quality assurance and therefore the measurement of care giving would appear difficult to quantify; much thought has been given to those over recent years, and systems are developed to quantify the great and bad aspects of practice. Although these issues impinge more on the moral than the legal side of health care delivery, the widespread adoption of audit mechanisms and quality assurance methods makes their inclusion a subject of necessity.</p>\r\n<p>Record keeping, whether computerized or paper based, is, many would say, the bane of health care work. Despite this, record-keeping is extremely important and can&rsquo;t be neglected; legal proceedings may take many years to come to court, memories fade, and every one which will be left is that the record made at the time of the incident. Records also allow smooth handover either from one professional to a different or to facilitate communication among different groups of professionals concerned with the care of one client. Records therefore form an integral a part of care delivery.</p>\r\n<p>Even within the best-regulated world, things can and do get it wrong occasionally. Health care delivery is not any exception to the rule, and everyone three parties involved - the employer, the employee and the client - may at some time have cause for complaint. As health care delivery presents a more and more commercial face, consumers are likely to feel an increasing freedom to complain about poor service, even as they would in the other commercial service provision. An increasing trend on the part of complainants to resort to litigation if complaints cannot be controlled promptly and effectively makes effective complaints management a necessity.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Palliative Care</h3>\r\n<p>Palliative care provides healthcare and emotional support to those living with a serious illness and their families throughout the course of the illness and sometimes the patient&rsquo;s life [5]. Palliative care could be a variety of patient-centred long-term care that prioritizes the standard of lifetime of the patient. It is not limited to older adults. Palliative care is meant to treat the full person, not just their medical concerns. It combines coordinated care management with psychological support for patients and their families as they navigate life with serious illness. Psychological support includes help with stress or depression. Both are critical quality-of-life concerns that are often overlooked in traditional care. Other features of a good palliative care program include around-the- clock access to a clinician; care that is coordinated across multiple specialties and care that is aligned with the priorities of the patient- including end-of-life preferences.</p>\r\n<p>Five percent of the foremost ill patients living with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations account for 60 percent of the full cost of healthcare within the US. Eighty-nine percent of this population will live for more than a year. Palliative care not only enables a much better quality of life for people living with illness and their families, but also it is value-based care that may substantially lower healthcare costs. This savings is best when care is delivered within the home setting. It is possible to require care of three people in their home for the identical cost as keeping one person in a very long-term care residence. When care is coordinated across the continuum, it is more efficient and reduces redundancies, medical error, unnecessary care, length of hospital stays, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, overall healthcare utilization, patient depression and pain, and conflicting care and medications.</p>\r\n<p>Overtreatment and over testing raise healthcare costs for insurers and for the patient and their families. In the US, overtreatment results in each household paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for unnecessary care annually. Not all families can bear the brunt of the costs without compromising on other important spending like food, education, and their own healthcare. This drives a rise within the social determinants that result in poor health, which eventually costs the healthcare system more within the long term. It should be noted that out-of-pocket costs influence lower-income households more strongly than medium- and upper- income households, thus perpetuating a cycle of poverty.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Devices</h3>\r\n<p>Three devices were involved here, the primary of which was a monitor for heart condition patients [2]. Patients weigh themselves and measure their blood pressure daily. The devices transmit the measurement figures to a server where they are coded for deviations and made them available to nurses in an exceedingly call center. Patients can keep track of their own measurements on their TV. Centre nurses monitor the daily figures; a sudden gain in weight may point to fluid retention that will, if neglected, be lethal to heart condition patients. Low blood pressure may point to medication problems. The call centre nurses follow informed deviations and discuss treatment options with the nurse within the hospital who is responsible for the patient.</p>\r\n<p>The second device monitors patients by asking those questions daily. The &lsquo;white box&rsquo; installed within the heart failure or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patient&rsquo;s home. The white box, a health friend, asks patients to look at their bodies for symptoms, because it did within the palliative care practice. In contrast to the palliative care practice, however, the white box also provides education and advice on good ways of living with heart failure or COPD. Specialist nurses within the hospital (in the case of cardiopathy and diabetes), in homecare (in the case of COPD) or assistants generally practices (in the case of diabetes) keep a watch on the answers that patients give and are warned by alarm signals if intervention is required.</p>\r\n<p>The third device is that the webcam employed by COPD patients related to a homecare institute. Here, patients have weekly webcam contact with nurses. Additionally, a touch screen gives patients access to a web site offering entertainment and news on neighborhood activities. A central Service Centre provides online bingo and other entertainment. The local homecare organization is responsible for care. Email and internet is available to advanced users. One homecare organization used both the webcam and therefore the white box for COPD patients.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Hospice</h3>\r\n<p>Hospice is a type of palliative care for people who have six months or less to live [6]. It is provided to both the patient and family and includes attention to the physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional needs of the dying. It is provided in many settings: home, nursing home, assisted living facility, or inpatient hospital. Although the U.S. Medicare Hospice Benefit affords terminally ill patients six months of hospice care, most patients use hospice care for fewer than 24 days. One reason why patients and families are not using hospice for the total extent of their eligible benefits is because physicians must refer them to hospice and most providers have difficulty communicating about hospice or difficulty determining the simplest time to refer to hospice care. When physicians are uncomfortable navigating end-of- life discussions and have a less positive attitude toward hospice, the result&rsquo;s more care that is aggressive and higher end-of-life spending.</p>\r\n<p>Nationally, individuals with advanced disease are referred to hospice very late in their illness journey, and most patients die receiving aggressive treatments. Providers also refer too late to hospice because the course of disease is unpredictable in chronic illness, and chronic illness has not previously received palliative care support. As an example, providers have difficulty predicting death for people living with dementia, and an absence awareness of palliative care keeps them from addressing the subject with patient/family members. Similarly, patients on haemodialysis have less predictive illness trajectories and providers who are less willing to speak about the prognostic outcomes of their patients leading to very low hospice use, averaging six days.</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of a health-literate delivery system, patient and family may receive conflicting messages from different specialty teams (e.g., between palliative care and oncology or between primary physician and palliative care. Decision support is therefore not available to patient/family who then must choose from their specialty teams and sometimes between the team and their primary care physician. With multiple healthcare providers involved in chronic illness care, clinical information about referral to hospice could also be miscommunicated among members of the healthcare team.</p>\r\n<p>For good reason, there is an absence of hospice health literacy; with a misconception, that hospice is just for care immediately before death. This results from a lack of trust, discomfort in talking about death (among providers/patients/family), and preference and reliance on religious beliefs over medical advice. For instance, among Latinos on haemodialysis, barriers to hospice care include family reluctance to possess advance care planning discussions. However, when both patient and caregiver understand that the disease is incurable, they are more likely to prefer hospice.</p>\r\n<p>Today, the principles of hospice are applied to a broader population (including those with chronic illness) through palliative care, with the goal of reaching these patients much earlier in their illness or disease process. Palliative care permits patients to receive curative, life-prolonging treatment simultaneously with receiving care that enhances quality of life. It is holistic care that treats the whole person, not merely the disease. It involves both curative treatment by physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers and emotional, psychological, and spiritual care by a team of specialists including social workers, psychologists, and chaplains. While early literature in palliative care looked exclusively at end- of-life care, patients are now receiving the comforts of palliative care as they suffer chronic, not necessarily terminal, illnesses, making family caregivers even more central and critical to the caregiving process.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">End of Life</h3>\r\n<p>Family members may communicate care providers to assist them understand what to expect when their loved one is dying [7]. Patients who are very near the end of life display a series of signs that predict the closeness of their deaths. One in every of the primary signs may be a decrease in engagement with one&rsquo;s surroundings and in communication. Because the body is preparing to die, the patient decreases his/her oral intake. This is often often the foremost difficult change for members of the family, as they will become concerned that their loved one is suffering and starving. Often it is enough to clarify to them that this can be a part of the normal dying process. Most of the time, patients do not report being hungry or thirsty, although they will complain of a dry mouth. In this case, effective mouth care with moistened sponges and a lip balm is sufficient.</p>\r\n<p>As the dying process continues, the patient will become progressively somnolent, with fewer and shorter awake periods. Sometimes the patient may become confused or restless. The clarity of hearing and vision is additionally often seen to decrease. Members of the family sometimes ask if their loved one continues to be able to hear them. Hearing is that the last one amongst the five senses to be lost and family members should be invited to continue talking to their loved one.</p>\r\n<p>As oral intake decreases and metabolic changes continue, urine output will decrease and therefore the urine are going to be more concentrated. When very near death, patients may develop urinary and bowel incontinence. Other physical changes include alterations in temperature and blood pressure, increased perspiration, and skin changes, like mottling or a pale, yellowish pallor. Breathing changes also occur, including increased, decreased, or irregular respirations, yet as periods of apnea. Because the patient is becoming weaker and more somnolent, s/ he is not any longer able to clear the throat or cough. Secretions begin to pool within the throat directly above the vocal cords. As air is passing by these secretions, the sound produced could also be loud and rattling, often referred to as &ldquo;death rattle.&rdquo; members of the family who never have witnessed somebody dying may become concerned and wonder if the patient is &ldquo;drowning.&rdquo; very often, comparing the death rattle to snoring can comfort them; like snoring, this sound could also be disturbing to the person hearing it, but isn&rsquo;t uncomfortable to the person producing it. Measures to decrease the death rattle include simply repositioning the head or the use of anticholinergic medications. Deep suction is not recommended, because it is uncomfortable and might result in bleeding.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, of great importance are nursing interventions, like daily bathing, good mouth care, and application of artificial tears and lubricating ointment to the eyes, also as comfortable positioning within the bed with pillows placed under the calves or other areas of support. Members of the family could also be instructed within these nursing interventions and participate in the care of their loved one. This often is very meaningful and comforting to both the patient and members of the family.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Call Centre</h3>\r\n<p>The carers involved in telecare do not question the importance of meeting patients within the same space, but they will delegate actual meetings to particular professionals while others take care of the telecare [2]. This happened, for example, when a center linked up with specialist heart condition teams in hospitals. The hospital nurses met patients in their offices, whereas the call centre nurses used the telecare device and the phone. The requirement of meeting the patient was uncontested. Alternatively, was it?</p>\r\n<p>The nurse directed the eyes of the patient to watch the relevant clinical signs for heart failure. However, she did over that. She invited the patient to speak about standard of living to focus the &lsquo;clinical eye&rsquo; and interpret the signs for his or her relevance. In telling their stories, patients gave the nurse relevant information about their condition without being tuned in to it. Symptoms are retold in stories about everyday practices. Do patients get dead set the shops, whether or not they say their ankles are okay? Interestingly, being unable to see patients also revealed the advantages of not seeing patients. Here, telecare disconnects daily life from useful information.</p>\r\n<p>Telecare practices where nurses did not see patients, however, also challenged this &lsquo;rock bottom of clinical knowledge&rsquo;. Nurses thought of styles of care that failed to need meetings with patients within the same space. At the same time, the monitoring system changed what problems were relevant to look at out for. It reduced the prospect of spotting relevant signs in any situation, but it increased the frequency of monitoring specific symptoms. Only the monitored figures started deviating did the nurse retrieve older and broader norms to interpret the deviations?</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Patients</h3>\r\n<p>The intent to revive total control over their lives and increasing that control to end the life at the time pre-determined by the patient is one big controversial and debatable topic in modern medical science [8]. The explanations may differ why the terminally ill patients may decide that why wait for death to embrace them once they can embrace the death at their own preferential times. The legal and ethical system does not endorse this ideology because their understanding is that the modern palliative medicine can overcome the patients&rsquo; fears of loss of control over their terminal symptoms by effective and aggressive palliation. Still a very few states respect persons&rsquo; decisions to end their lives at their own free will and practice euthanasia and/or physician assisted suicide. This very small percentage of worldwide community practicing the debatable palliative concept may represent the analogous very small percent of terminal patients who if given the chance, will decisively complete their wishes for death despite aggressive palliative support.</p>\r\n<p>At the time of diagnosis of their terminal disease, the patients decide to end their lives because of their poor understanding of the disease and its terminal symptoms and the failure of treatment teams to pursue timely efficacious discussions about their diseases. Because the disease evolves, the patient understands their diseases and also the supportive care offered and rendered by the palliative care teams; and at this point of time, they may decide that this could be the correct time to require the ultimate flight at their own leisure because they feel that it&rsquo;s going to be the proper thing to try and do. However, eventually, the patient despite attempting to sell their thought for dying at their chosen time finally ends up losing their full competence or control on their mental status; and are left at the mercy of their family or surrogate decision maker to choose for what they need been asking all the time: timely death. Additionally, while the surrogate decision making endorses the withdrawing and withholding the life-sustaining treatments as terminal palliative management protocols, however, rather than the pre-determined times by the patients&rsquo; choices, now the death is occurring when the surrogates and medical teams based on their understanding and perception of the progressive terminal disease decides to let go the patient.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Refusal of Assistance</h3>\r\n<p>The moral discussion of providing nourishment or hydration has primarily addressed the refusal of someone who can assist [9]. However, there are limitations on the chance of assisting that arise not from any unwillingness to help, but from circumstances which may render impossible either the activities within which assisting consists or their successful outcomes. Examples of the primary impossibility include situations within which the needed food and water are unavailable, likewise as those within which the person in need cannot eat, drink, or swallow and other technologies for providing nourishment and hydration are not accessible to care providers. An example of the second impossibility is that the futility of providing nutrition and hydration when nutrients and hydration cannot be absorbed by a debilitated or imminently dying person. In such cases, one cannot really assist the person in need, and once that is clear the effort to try and do so is irrational, and obviously not an ethical obligation.</p>\r\n<p>A practically important and sometimes epistemic ally complex form of impossibility can emerge from a patient&rsquo;s refusal of assistance. In some of these cases, those seeking to assist can overcome this rejection, perhaps by coaxing the person to eat or drink what is provided; but in other cases, the patient may well be confused or incapable of understanding persuasive efforts to the purpose that there is not a rational refusal of assistance but rather an uncontrollable incapacity to cooperate. In such cases-e.g., frail, elderly patient incapacitated by dementia-providing the help might prove impossible. Alternatives to feeding or helping the person to drink might rather be unavailable, or perhaps excluded for the identical reasons helping to feed the person is excluded&mdash;the person might systematically pull out feeding tubes. Acquiescing within the futility of trying to overcome this resistance is not refusing assistance but recognizing impossibility.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, honoring such a refusal of feeding on the part of a disabled patient who is deemed competent to create such decisions is sometimes also the recognition of the impossibility of assisting. One wishing to help may come to acknowledge that force-feeding a recalcitrant person has limited effectiveness and might well cause grave incidental harm. Of course, even when there&rsquo;s no impossibility present, the costs of helping, broadly understood, will be so high and also the prospects of success so dim that, one able to help might reasonably desist.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, within the context of a medical facility, the strong presumption of healthcare favoring a competent patient&rsquo;s right to refuse actions on his or her person, whether or not these aren&rsquo;t narrowly medical, remains in place. Here the impossibility of providing assistance is based on reasonable human convention, not biology. However, there is an impossibility: one cannot assist without violating this norm. That norm does not imply that those honoring it accept a patient&rsquo;s decision as morally correct. For it has not supported the concept that patients&rsquo; desires establish what is morally right, but instead is established on a division of responsibility, and thus authority, for health related decisions among the parties to them. In short, the serious refusal of a person to just accept food and drink, or more technologically based alternatives like tube-feeding appears generally, but not universally, to be a special case of the impossibility of rendering assistance.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Palliative care seeks to ensure the quality of life of palliative patients, the last stage of life in which every person strives for integration and reconciliation. The basic skill in palliative care is the control and alleviation of symptoms, especially pain, combining physical, social, psychological and spiritual forms of help in preserving the dignity of the patient and his integrity, but also the integrity of the family. An interdisciplinary approach, coordination and cooperation can slow down and alleviate the presence of symptoms and signs, especially pain whether the patient is at home or in an inpatient setting. Relieving symptoms, pain, suffering, preserving the quality of life and integrity of patients are fundamental features of palliative care that are needed but not always available.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1.

To improve these results, specific adjuvant methods were used, such as Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) and vein conduits. The goal of this study was to assess whether the use of platelet-rich fibrin and vein conduits after nerve suture improve nerve regeneration as measured by a functional score and histomorphometry analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Ten isogenic spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomly assigned to each of the following experimental procedure: 1 ) Sham group (n=10); 2) Nerve Graft (NG) group (n=10); 3 ) Nerve Graft Covered with Vein conduit (NGVC) group (n=10); and 4) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with PRF (NGVCP) group (n=10). Nerve repair result was evaluated by calculating the sciatic functional index (SFI) at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days; morphometric and morphologic analysis of the distal nerve; and histological analysis of Fluoro-Gold stained motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Compared to the Sham control group, the NGVC and NGVCP groups exhibited lower SFI in all measures. The NGVC group showed improvement in SFI at day 90, which was statistically significant compared to the NG group. The fiber and axon diameters were comparable in the NGVC and NGVCP groups, which were significantly lower than those in the Sham and NG groups. The NGVC group showed statistically significant functional improvement in SFI at day 90 compared to the NG group. Despite these findings, additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of adjuvant treatments in peripheral nerve repair.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Nerve graft; Nerve regeneration; Platelet- rich fibrin; Sciatic nerve; Vein graft</p>', '<p>The evolution of microsurgical nerve repair techniques, as previously described by Millesi [1], has been greatly influenced by the use of surgical microscopes and more delicate materials, leading to improved functional results. One such surgical technique is nerve grafting, which is required to treat loss of nerve substance, whether due to trauma or nerve ending retraction [2,3]; to date, no method has been shown to be superior to autologous nerve graft [4]. Altissimi et al. [5] reported favorable results regarding digital nerve injury; however, these were significant only in children. Therefore, there is a need for further studies of nerve repair techniques to improve the results of nerve regeneration in adult populations. Previous studies have shown that conduits are important for nerve regeneration, because they confine neurotrophic and neurotropic substances, guiding axonal growth towards a distal target [4,6]. To date, the ideal coating material has not been identified; however, veins have been successfully used as biological substrate for axonal regeneration [7,8]. More recently, new substances, such as platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), have been developed for use in surgical repair of nerve injury. These substances contain growth factors such as transforming growth factor &szlig; (TGF-&szlig;, which stimulates mitosis, chemotaxis, and osteoblast collagen deposition), insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II, which stimulate proliferation, cell differentiation, and collagen biosynthesis), vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [9-11]. To improve nerve regeneration in cases of nerve injuries requiring nerve grafts, we evaluated the use of a vein conduit covering the nerve grafts either alone or filled with PRF in sciatic nerve injury repair in isogenic spontaneously hypertensive rats. Nerve function was assessed by calculation of sciatic functional index (SFI), CatWalk gait analysis [12,13], morphometric and morphological analysis of the sciatic nerve distal to the injury, and motor neuron count in the anterior horn of the spinal cord [14].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and Methods</h3>\r\n<p>The Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA/ UNIFESP no: 0294/12) at the Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo approved this study. Surgical procedures were performed in the Laboratory of Microsurgery, Division of Hand and Upper Limb Surgery of the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo (UNIFESP). A total of 40 male 8-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats with an average weight of 250 grams were used in this study. The choice for SHR was made considering that the animals were isogenic and, consequently, both the vein conduit and the blood used to obtain PRF could be used without the possibility of rejection. The animals were obtained from the Center for Development of Experimental Models (Centro de Desenvolvimento de Modelos Experimentais, CEDEME). Animals were randomly divided into the following procedure groups: 1) Sham control (Sham) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure including sciatic nerve exposure, but not nerve resection (n=10); 2) Nerve Graft (NG) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure in which 8-mm of the sciatic nerve were excised, inverted, and sutured (n=10); 3) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit (NGVC) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure in which 8-mm of the sciatic nerve were excised, inverted, covered with jugular vein, and sutured (n=10); and 4) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre- filled with PRF (NGVCP) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure in which 8-mm of the sciatic nerve were excised, inverted, covered with jugular vein pre-filled with PRF, and sutured (n=10).</p>\r\n<p>In this study, animal suffering was minimized by following protocols by the Brazilian Society of Laboratory Animal Science (SBCAL/COBEA) [15] and the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">PRF Preparation</h3>\r\n<p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of a solution containing xylazine and ketamine (0.1 ml/100 g). Approximately 6 ml of blood were collected from each rat by intracardiac puncture, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma was discarded and the gelatinous layer (PRF) was transferred to another tube, and thus separated from the red blood cell concentrate.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Surgical Technique</h3>\r\n<p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of xylazine and ketamine (0.1 ml/100 g) solution, followed by trichotomy and posterolateral access in the right thigh with the animal in ventral decubitus, and opening of the muscle layer between the vastus lateralis and the femoral biceps, with exposure of the sciatic nerve and its ramifications. In the Sham group, surgical procedure was performed up to exposure of the sciatic nerve, without resecting it. The incision was sutured with nylon monofilament 4.0 suture. For the remaining three groups (NG, NGVC, NGVCP) the nerve was carefully dissected, and an 8- mm segment was excised, leaving a distal stump of approximately 3 mm before its ramification. The nerve segment used as graft was inverted and sutured with monofilament 10.0 suture (Figure 1). In experimental groups NGVC and NGVCP, the external jugular vein was removed through a latero-lateral cervical access between the pectoral and sternocleidomastoid muscles through ligation of tributaries, and a 12-mm segment was isolated, everted, and sutured in the nerve graft. The graft stumps were inserted starting at the end of the vein conduits. The muscle layer and skin were sutured with monofilament 4.0 suture.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(8).png\" width=\"555\" height=\"164\" /></p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 1:</b> Nerve Graft (NG) group surgical procedure photograph.

Paracetamol (1.5 mg/ml) was provided in drinking water, and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) was administered orally every 24 hours for 5 days, or if signs of pain were detected. Pain and discomfort were assessed according to the parameters recommended by the Laboratory Animal Care and Procedures Manual [15,16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Gait Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>All animals were subjected to gait testing to obtain the SFI in the pre-operative period (SFI-0) and after 30, 60, and 90 post-operative days (SFI-30, SFI-60, and SFI-90, respectively) using the CATWALK system [12,13] (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). This system evaluates gait through a clear walkway that is coupled to a computer that records the animal&rsquo;s footprints, and uses this information to calculate the SFI (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(5).png\" width=\"502\" height=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 2:</b> Mean Sciatic Functional Index (SFI) for each experimental group throughout the study period (0, 30, 60 and 90 days postsurgery). 1) Sham control group; 2) Nerve graft (NG) group; 3) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit (NGVC) group; 4) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with PRF (NGVCP) group.</p>\r\n<p>168x111mm (300 x 300 DPI).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sciatic Nerve Fragment Removal and Neuronal Labeling</h3>\r\n<p>After 120 days post-surgery, animals were subjected to a second surgical&reg;procedure to perform neuronal labeling with Fluoro-Gold (Fluorochrome Inc., Denver, Colorado, USA), a retrograde tracer. The sciatic nerve was sectioned and a 3-mm fragment was removed, distal to the second suture, and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde at 4&deg;C for 24 hours. Motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord were stained with 3% Fluoro-Gold, a retrograde tracer, for 90 minutes, followed by closing of the muscle layer with mono nylon 4-0. Nerve fragments were processed and analyzed at the Electron Microscopy Center at the Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo (CEME/UNIFESP) as follows: fragments were incubated with 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.2 M sodium cacodylate for 12 hours. Subsequently, samples were washed with isotonic sodium cacodylate buffer (0.025 M, pH 7.4) and dehydrated in solutions of increasing ethanol and propylene oxide concentration, and were then embedded in plastic resin (Epon 812&reg;) for 72 hours at 60&deg;C. A microtome (Reichert-Jung super nova&reg;, Leica-Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to cut semi-thin sections (0.25&ndash;0.5 &micro;m) of nerve samples, which were subsequently stained with toluidine blue for morphologic and morphometric analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Transcardial Perfusion and Spinal Cord Removal</h3>\r\n<p>Forty-eight hours after neuronal labeling, animals were subjected to transcardial perfusion followed by laminectomy and removal of the spinal cord fragment. The L4, L5, and L6 fragment was preserved. The dorsal roots of L3 to S1 were cut and the spinal cord fragment was removed and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde fixing solution for 8 hours, then transferred to a 20% sucrose solution. Using a cryostat (Jung 2800E, Leica-Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany) 40-&micro;m histological sections were obtained and mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, and stored at 4&deg;C.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Morphometric and Morphologic Analyses</h3>\r\n<p>Morphometric and morphologic analyses were performed in samples from five randomly selected animals per group, manly because the semi-thin sections used to the analyses were performed in another section of the Institute that is costly, and also because in other studies of the same Institute it was verified that the nerves pattern were maintained. Images were captured using an optical microscope (Zeiss Imager MI &ndash; AX10, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), with a 10X magnification objective lens and Optovar 1 module, and processed with the AxioVision Imaging System (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). The image of a scale bar was captured under the same parameters. Morphometric analysis was performed using Image J 1.45 software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). After calibration, the nerves surrounding the perineurium were manually labeled to delineate the total nerve area. Next, the nerve images were randomly labeled with points of known distance to calculate the total nerve area. Fibers were counted in quadrants of predetermined size, and 50% of the fields were used to obtain the analyzed area and density of myelinated nerve fibers. Digital images were binarized to identify myelin fibers, and the identified fibers measured to obtain values of fiber diameter, axon diameter, myelin sheath thickness, and G-ratio, which is defined as the ratio between the axon diameter and the fiber diameter and is a measure of speed of nervous signal conduction. Morphological analysis was performed on images captured from semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue, in which Wallerian degeneration, small and large caliber myelinated fibers, and blood vessels could be visualized.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Spinal Cord Histological Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Using  a  fluorescent  microscope  (ZEIS&reg;S-Axiolab,  Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), Fluoro-Gold -labeled motor neurons were quantified on the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Since this analysis was made by an author of the study, it presented a low cost, so all the sections of all surviving rats were analyzed and labeled motor neurons were counted. For each animal, analysis was based on average data corrected by the Abercrombie [17] criteria.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Statistical Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Data   we&reg;re   classified   and   analyzed   using   SPSS software (IBM ). The Kolmogorov&ndash; Smirnov normality test was applied to quantitative variables. Parametric variables were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test. Non-parametric variables were analyzed with the Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test. The accepted p-value for statistical significance was p &lt; 0.05.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>In this study we evaluated the use of nerve graft, nerve graft covered with vein conduit and nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with PRF (NGVCP) in sciatic nerve injury repair in isogenic spontaneously hypertensive rats. Throughout the study, 10 animals died during the immediate   post-operativ&reg;e   period   of   neuronal   labeling, after use of Fluoro-Gold , or during anestesia and were desconsidered for the study. At the experimental endpoint, 30 animals remained and were distributed as follows: SHAM group, n=7; NG group, n=7; NGVC group, n=8; and NGVCP group, n=8. Only these surviving rats were accounted for the final results and showed in Table 1.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sciatic Functional Index</h3>\r\n<p>In the SHAM group, throughout the duration of the study, the SFI mean values remained close to zero and these are considered the best values. On the other hand, the NG group exhibited a sharp drop in SFI after the surgical procedure (SFI-30: -77.32) when compared to pre-operative SFI (SFI: -4.44). However, in this group, SFI improvement was observed at 60 and 90 post-operative days (SFI-60: -73.40; SFI-90: - 71.10). Similarly, in the NGVC group, a sudden worsening of the SFI was observed after surgery (SFI-30: -71.65), with a gradual recovery at 60 and 90 post- operative days (SFI-60: - 59.37 and SFI-90: -49.77). In the NGVCP group, after an abrupt worsening of the SFI (SFI- 30: -75.27), an improvement was also observed at 60 (SFI-60: -69.09) and 90 (SFI-90: -65.83) post-operative days. Groups were compared to determine statistical significance using one-way ANOVA, and significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) were found between the Sham group and the NG, NGVC, and NGVCP groups. Furthermore, the SFI-90 values were significantly different (p=0.029) and were better for the NGVC group in comparison to the NG group. While the NGVCP group showed a gradual improvement in SFI, this was not significantly different when compared to the NG and NGVC groups throughout the assessment period (Table 1 and Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(6).png\" width=\"376\" height=\"441\" /></p>\r\n<p>SFI index is presented for 0, 30, 60, and 90 days after surgery.

Large caliber myelinated fibers were observed, as well as preservation of endoneurial space. No signs of Wallerian degeneration were observed, and fascicles presented normal morphology. On the other hand, morphological alterations in nerve fascicles were observed in samples from the NG, NGVC, NGVCP groups, as evidenced by loss of large caliber myelinated fibers and the predominance of small caliber myelinated fibers, which suggests axonal budding. In these three groups, signs of Wallerian degeneration were also observed (Figure 3). The Sham group showed a myelinated fiber density per area of 41.68 &plusmn; 5.39, fiber diameter of 11.53 &plusmn; 0.34 &micro;m, axon diameter of 6.22 &plusmn; 0.23 &micro;m, and sheath thickness of 2.65 &plusmn; 0.17 &micro;m. Mean myelinated fiber density was 53.62 &plusmn; 12.14 in the NG group, 186.40 &plusmn; 50.95 in the NGVC group, and 163.20 &plusmn; 69.24 in the NGVCP group. No significant difference was found between the NGVC group and the NGVCP (p=0.83). However, the comparison of the NG and NGVCP groups (p=0.005) and of the NG and NGVC groups (p=0.001) presented both a significant statistical difference, since the myelinated fiber density was increased in the NGVC and the NGVCP groups. Mean nerve fiber diameter was 7.76 &plusmn; 0.27 mm in the NG group, 6.25 &plusmn; 1.05 mm in the NGVC group, and 5.35 &plusmn; 0.8 mm in the NGVCP group. The fiber diameter of the NGVC group was significantly reduced compared to the Sham (p=0.0001) and NG (p=0.018) groups; however, no significant difference was observed when compared to the NGVCP group (p=0.217).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure3(4).png\" width=\"342\" height=\"261\" /></p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 3:</b> Photomicrograph of sciatic nerve semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue. a) Sham group; b) nerve graft (NG) group; c) Nerve Graft Covered with Vein Conduit (NGVC) group; d) nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with platelet-rich fibrin (NGVCP) group.

Repair of large and complex nerve losses usually require nerve grafting [18]. Improvement of post-operative functional results is a current challenge faced by physicians and researchers [19]. Although some recovery of functional nerve capacity can currently be achieved, we are far from reaching an ideal solution for peripheral nerve reconstruction [20]. Following a report by Chiu and colleagues [21], in which autogenous vein graft was used as conduit for nerve regeneration in animal models, several clinical studies have showed that small vein segments could serve as conduits for nerve regeneration in humans [22,23]. Vein grafts provide a favorable microenvironment for axonal regeneration as well as serving as a biological barrier against scar tissue invasion [24]. Piskin et al. [25] reported that synthetic conduits interfere with regeneration inside the tubes. Natural conduits offer several advantages including abundant donor sites for autogenous vein graft, absence of deficits upon removal, low cost, and a lack of immunological implications. As described by Wang et al. [26], Ferrari et al.[8], Gravvanis et al.[27], and Jeon et al.[28], we opted to place the vein conduit inside-out (everted), aiming to maintain a collagen-rich adventitia in the inside of the tube, and thus favor nerve regeneration.</p>\r\n<p>Nerve regeneration is stimulated by growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF- &szlig;1), which stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells [29,30]. Vein conduits release neurotrophic factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) [7,8]. In this study, we used platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), which forms a stiff membrane that remains intact for up to 7 days and allows the slow release of growth factors, as previously described by Dohan et al. [31]. The gradual release of growth factors constitutes an advantage of PRF over platelet-rich plasma (PRP), because growth factors in PRP are released during the first hours and completely dissolved within approximately 3 days [32]. Among other PRF advantages are the low cost and ease of preparation, making it a reasonable product for clinical use. In the study by Kim Yeong et al. [33], the authors used rats with 10-mm long sciatic nerve defects to compare the effects of autologous nerve graft, inside-out vein grafts, and inside- out vein grafts filled with PRP on SFI. Similar to our results, that study showed that SFI at 90 days post-surgery ranged from -60 to -80. In that study, the group with PRP pre- filled vein conduits had a mean SFI-90 of -65, compared to our results in which SFI-90 was - 49 for the NGVC and -65 for the NGVCP groups. Furthermore, in our study, the SFI-90 of the NG group was -71, comparable to an SFI-90 of -60 obtained by Kim Yeong et al. In the Lichtenfels study [34], the use of autologous nerve graft, saline solution pre-filled silicone tube, silicone tube with PRP, and silicone tube with PRF were compared to evaluate the repair of a 10-mm gap. Their SFI-90 results were different from ours in autologous nerve graft (-42.39 &plusmn; 10.348 versus -71 &plusmn; 4.8 in our study), but the SFI-90 they observed for PRP (- 55.86 &plusmn; 11.2) and PRF (-53.5 &plusmn; 11.88) pre-filled tubes were similar to the NGVC (-49 &plusmn; 22) and NGVCP (-65 &plusmn; 6.2) groups in our study.</p>\r\n<p>In previous studies, different models of nerve loss have been used, making the comparison among studies challenging. Regardless of gap size, the SFI-60 of our NG group was similar to that reported by Oliveira et al. [35] (5- mm gap, SFI-60: -83.46), Rafiuddin et al. [36] (10 mm gap, SFI-60: -79.9), and Sabongi et. Al [20] (8-mm gap, SFI-60: -76.4). Our results show that the adjuvant methods used to assist nerve damage repair were unable to restore the SFI values to those seen in the Sham control group. However, compared to the NG group, animals in the NGVC group displayed a statistically significant improvement at post-2.6 to 4.1 &micro;m found in our study. Finally, myelin sheath thickness also exhibited variations between studies, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 &micro;m in the Lichtenfels et al. [34] study and 1.3 to 1.7 &micro;m in our study. In this study, morphologic and morphometric analysis showed that the NG group showed a significantly greater nerve fiber diameter and axon diameter when compared to NGVC and NGVCP groups, and significantly greater myelin sheath thickness compared to the NGVCP group. This analysis showed that the increase in fiber density in the NGVC and NGVCP groups was due to axonal sprouting resulting from the nerve injury. The increase in number of fibers was attributed to the large number of small caliber fibers. The NGVC group presented a significant increase in fiber density when compared to Sham and NG groups, with no difference when compared to NGVCP group. The number of fibers is known to increase considerably up to 3 months after nerve injury, plateau after 6 to 9 months, and return to basal levels after 1 year [14,37]. Similar to observations in previous studies [38,39], our data does not support an association between SFI and morphometric analysis. G-ratio, defined as the ratio between axon diameter and fiber diameter, was 0.53 for the Sham control group, 0.52 for the NG group, 0.47 for the NGVC group, and 0.48 for the NGVCP group. The normal reference value for the G-ratio is close to 0.6, which maximizes nervous conduction. On the other hand, a value close to zero is indicative of axonal atrophy, and demyelination is suggested by a G- ratio value close to 1 [37,40].</p>\r\n<p>The  number  of  motor  neurons  in  the  ante&reg;rior  horn operative day 90, which may suggest advancement in the of the spinal cord was assessed by Fluoro-Gold staining. surgical technique used to repair severe nerve injuries to achieve better functional results. This improvement may be explained by the vein&rsquo;s release of factors, or by the vein itself serving as a conduit for axonal reorientation. The NGVCP group, on the other hand, did not show the same improvement, and this may be explained for the fact that the PRF factors released were not as effective as expected. In the Kim Yeong et al. [33] study, histological analysis at week 8 showed a myelin sheath thickness in the autologous graft group of 0.9 &plusmn; 0.21 &micro;m, compared to 1.7 &plusmn; 0.8 &micro;m for our NG group. Axon diameter values also diverged between Kim et al.&rsquo;s autologous nerve graft group (2.9 &plusmn; 0.73 &micro;m) and the NG group in our study (4.1 &plusmn; 0.4 &micro;m). However, the remaining groups presented similar myelin sheath and axon diameter values between the two studies.</p>\r\n<p>Histomorphometric analyses reported by Lichtenfels et al. 34, performed at 12 weeks, showed no statistically significant difference in axonal diameter and myelin sheath thickness among experimental groups (p = 0.05) despite their suggestion that PRP and PRF exerted a positive effect on functional nerve recovery. Among groups, axonal diameter varied from 3 to 4 &micro;m, which is similar to the variation of While there was no significant difference between the NG, NGVC, and NGVCP groups, our data showed statistically significant differences between those groups and the Sham control group. The number of positively labeled cells can represent the degree of nerve reconnection to the spinal cord, and is considered an ideal method to assess nerve function [37].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Compared to the Sham control group, all experimental groups exhibited a statistically significant decrease in the functional and histomorphometric analyzed parameters. The NGVC group showed a statistically significant functional improvement in SFI-90 when compared to the NG group. This improvement may be explained by the veins release of factors, or the vein itself serving as a conduit for axonal reorientation. Although a significant improvement was expected with the use of PRF, it was verified that the release of factors from this substance, in this case, was not so effective. Additional studies are required to evaluate the role of adjuvants in peripheral nerve injury repair with nerve grafting.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8412630/\" target=\"_blank\"> Millesi H (1993) Forty-two years of peripheral nerve surgery.

The goal of this study was to assess whether the use of platelet-rich fibrin and vein conduits after nerve suture improve nerve regeneration as measured by a functional score and histomorphometry analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Ten isogenic spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomly assigned to each of the following experimental procedure: 1 ) Sham group (n=10); 2) Nerve Graft (NG) group (n=10); 3 ) Nerve Graft Covered with Vein conduit (NGVC) group (n=10); and 4) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with PRF (NGVCP) group (n=10). Nerve repair result was evaluated by calculating the sciatic functional index (SFI) at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days; morphometric and morphologic analysis of the distal nerve; and histological analysis of Fluoro-Gold stained motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Compared to the Sham control group, the NGVC and NGVCP groups exhibited lower SFI in all measures. The NGVC group showed improvement in SFI at day 90, which was statistically significant compared to the NG group. The fiber and axon diameters were comparable in the NGVC and NGVCP groups, which were significantly lower than those in the Sham and NG groups. The NGVC group showed statistically significant functional improvement in SFI at day 90 compared to the NG group. Despite these findings, additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of adjuvant treatments in peripheral nerve repair.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Nerve graft; Nerve regeneration; Platelet- rich fibrin; Sciatic nerve; Vein graft</p>', '<p>The evolution of microsurgical nerve repair techniques, as previously described by Millesi [1], has been greatly influenced by the use of surgical microscopes and more delicate materials, leading to improved functional results. One such surgical technique is nerve grafting, which is required to treat loss of nerve substance, whether due to trauma or nerve ending retraction [2,3]; to date, no method has been shown to be superior to autologous nerve graft [4]. Altissimi et al. [5] reported favorable results regarding digital nerve injury; however, these were significant only in children. Therefore, there is a need for further studies of nerve repair techniques to improve the results of nerve regeneration in adult populations. Previous studies have shown that conduits are important for nerve regeneration, because they confine neurotrophic and neurotropic substances, guiding axonal growth towards a distal target [4,6]. To date, the ideal coating material has not been identified; however, veins have been successfully used as biological substrate for axonal regeneration [7,8]. More recently, new substances, such as platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), have been developed for use in surgical repair of nerve injury. These substances contain growth factors such as transforming growth factor &szlig; (TGF-&szlig;, which stimulates mitosis, chemotaxis, and osteoblast collagen deposition), insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II, which stimulate proliferation, cell differentiation, and collagen biosynthesis), vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [9-11]. To improve nerve regeneration in cases of nerve injuries requiring nerve grafts, we evaluated the use of a vein conduit covering the nerve grafts either alone or filled with PRF in sciatic nerve injury repair in isogenic spontaneously hypertensive rats. Nerve function was assessed by calculation of sciatic functional index (SFI), CatWalk gait analysis [12,13], morphometric and morphological analysis of the sciatic nerve distal to the injury, and motor neuron count in the anterior horn of the spinal cord [14].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and Methods</h3>\r\n<p>The Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA/ UNIFESP no: 0294/12) at the Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo approved this study. Surgical procedures were performed in the Laboratory of Microsurgery, Division of Hand and Upper Limb Surgery of the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo (UNIFESP). A total of 40 male 8-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats with an average weight of 250 grams were used in this study. The choice for SHR was made considering that the animals were isogenic and, consequently, both the vein conduit and the blood used to obtain PRF could be used without the possibility of rejection. The animals were obtained from the Center for Development of Experimental Models (Centro de Desenvolvimento de Modelos Experimentais, CEDEME). Animals were randomly divided into the following procedure groups: 1) Sham control (Sham) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure including sciatic nerve exposure, but not nerve resection (n=10); 2) Nerve Graft (NG) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure in which 8-mm of the sciatic nerve were excised, inverted, and sutured (n=10); 3) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit (NGVC) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure in which 8-mm of the sciatic nerve were excised, inverted, covered with jugular vein, and sutured (n=10); and 4) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre- filled with PRF (NGVCP) group: animals were subjected to a surgical procedure in which 8-mm of the sciatic nerve were excised, inverted, covered with jugular vein pre-filled with PRF, and sutured (n=10).</p>\r\n<p>In this study, animal suffering was minimized by following protocols by the Brazilian Society of Laboratory Animal Science (SBCAL/COBEA) [15] and the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">PRF Preparation</h3>\r\n<p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of a solution containing xylazine and ketamine (0.1 ml/100 g). Approximately 6 ml of blood were collected from each rat by intracardiac puncture, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma was discarded and the gelatinous layer (PRF) was transferred to another tube, and thus separated from the red blood cell concentrate.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Surgical Technique</h3>\r\n<p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of xylazine and ketamine (0.1 ml/100 g) solution, followed by trichotomy and posterolateral access in the right thigh with the animal in ventral decubitus, and opening of the muscle layer between the vastus lateralis and the femoral biceps, with exposure of the sciatic nerve and its ramifications. In the Sham group, surgical procedure was performed up to exposure of the sciatic nerve, without resecting it. The incision was sutured with nylon monofilament 4.0 suture. For the remaining three groups (NG, NGVC, NGVCP) the nerve was carefully dissected, and an 8- mm segment was excised, leaving a distal stump of approximately 3 mm before its ramification. The nerve segment used as graft was inverted and sutured with monofilament 10.0 suture (Figure 1). In experimental groups NGVC and NGVCP, the external jugular vein was removed through a latero-lateral cervical access between the pectoral and sternocleidomastoid muscles through ligation of tributaries, and a 12-mm segment was isolated, everted, and sutured in the nerve graft. The graft stumps were inserted starting at the end of the vein conduits. The muscle layer and skin were sutured with monofilament 4.0 suture.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(8).png\" width=\"555\" height=\"164\" /></p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 1:</b> Nerve Graft (NG) group surgical procedure photograph.

Paracetamol (1.5 mg/ml) was provided in drinking water, and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) was administered orally every 24 hours for 5 days, or if signs of pain were detected. Pain and discomfort were assessed according to the parameters recommended by the Laboratory Animal Care and Procedures Manual [15,16].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Gait Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>All animals were subjected to gait testing to obtain the SFI in the pre-operative period (SFI-0) and after 30, 60, and 90 post-operative days (SFI-30, SFI-60, and SFI-90, respectively) using the CATWALK system [12,13] (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). This system evaluates gait through a clear walkway that is coupled to a computer that records the animal&rsquo;s footprints, and uses this information to calculate the SFI (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(5).png\" width=\"502\" height=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 2:</b> Mean Sciatic Functional Index (SFI) for each experimental group throughout the study period (0, 30, 60 and 90 days postsurgery). 1) Sham control group; 2) Nerve graft (NG) group; 3) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit (NGVC) group; 4) Nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with PRF (NGVCP) group.</p>\r\n<p>168x111mm (300 x 300 DPI).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sciatic Nerve Fragment Removal and Neuronal Labeling</h3>\r\n<p>After 120 days post-surgery, animals were subjected to a second surgical&reg;procedure to perform neuronal labeling with Fluoro-Gold (Fluorochrome Inc., Denver, Colorado, USA), a retrograde tracer. The sciatic nerve was sectioned and a 3-mm fragment was removed, distal to the second suture, and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde at 4&deg;C for 24 hours. Motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord were stained with 3% Fluoro-Gold, a retrograde tracer, for 90 minutes, followed by closing of the muscle layer with mono nylon 4-0. Nerve fragments were processed and analyzed at the Electron Microscopy Center at the Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo (CEME/UNIFESP) as follows: fragments were incubated with 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.2 M sodium cacodylate for 12 hours. Subsequently, samples were washed with isotonic sodium cacodylate buffer (0.025 M, pH 7.4) and dehydrated in solutions of increasing ethanol and propylene oxide concentration, and were then embedded in plastic resin (Epon 812&reg;) for 72 hours at 60&deg;C. A microtome (Reichert-Jung super nova&reg;, Leica-Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to cut semi-thin sections (0.25&ndash;0.5 &micro;m) of nerve samples, which were subsequently stained with toluidine blue for morphologic and morphometric analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Transcardial Perfusion and Spinal Cord Removal</h3>\r\n<p>Forty-eight hours after neuronal labeling, animals were subjected to transcardial perfusion followed by laminectomy and removal of the spinal cord fragment. The L4, L5, and L6 fragment was preserved. The dorsal roots of L3 to S1 were cut and the spinal cord fragment was removed and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde fixing solution for 8 hours, then transferred to a 20% sucrose solution. Using a cryostat (Jung 2800E, Leica-Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany) 40-&micro;m histological sections were obtained and mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, and stored at 4&deg;C.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Morphometric and Morphologic Analyses</h3>\r\n<p>Morphometric and morphologic analyses were performed in samples from five randomly selected animals per group, manly because the semi-thin sections used to the analyses were performed in another section of the Institute that is costly, and also because in other studies of the same Institute it was verified that the nerves pattern were maintained. Images were captured using an optical microscope (Zeiss Imager MI &ndash; AX10, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), with a 10X magnification objective lens and Optovar 1 module, and processed with the AxioVision Imaging System (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). The image of a scale bar was captured under the same parameters. Morphometric analysis was performed using Image J 1.45 software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). After calibration, the nerves surrounding the perineurium were manually labeled to delineate the total nerve area. Next, the nerve images were randomly labeled with points of known distance to calculate the total nerve area. Fibers were counted in quadrants of predetermined size, and 50% of the fields were used to obtain the analyzed area and density of myelinated nerve fibers. Digital images were binarized to identify myelin fibers, and the identified fibers measured to obtain values of fiber diameter, axon diameter, myelin sheath thickness, and G-ratio, which is defined as the ratio between the axon diameter and the fiber diameter and is a measure of speed of nervous signal conduction. Morphological analysis was performed on images captured from semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue, in which Wallerian degeneration, small and large caliber myelinated fibers, and blood vessels could be visualized.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Spinal Cord Histological Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Using  a  fluorescent  microscope  (ZEIS&reg;S-Axiolab,  Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), Fluoro-Gold -labeled motor neurons were quantified on the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Since this analysis was made by an author of the study, it presented a low cost, so all the sections of all surviving rats were analyzed and labeled motor neurons were counted. For each animal, analysis was based on average data corrected by the Abercrombie [17] criteria.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Statistical Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Data   we&reg;re   classified   and   analyzed   using   SPSS software (IBM ). The Kolmogorov&ndash; Smirnov normality test was applied to quantitative variables. Parametric variables were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test. Non-parametric variables were analyzed with the Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test. The accepted p-value for statistical significance was p &lt; 0.05.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>In this study we evaluated the use of nerve graft, nerve graft covered with vein conduit and nerve graft covered with vein conduit pre-filled with PRF (NGVCP) in sciatic nerve injury repair in isogenic spontaneously hypertensive rats. Throughout the study, 10 animals died during the immediate   post-operativ&reg;e   period   of   neuronal   labeling, after use of Fluoro-Gold , or during anestesia and were desconsidered for the study. At the experimental endpoint, 30 animals remained and were distributed as follows: SHAM group, n=7; NG group, n=7; NGVC group, n=8; and NGVCP group, n=8. Only these surviving rats were accounted for the final results and showed in Table 1.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sciatic Functional Index</h3>\r\n<p>In the SHAM group, throughout the duration of the study, the SFI mean values remained close to zero and these are considered the best values. On the other hand, the NG group exhibited a sharp drop in SFI after the surgical procedure (SFI-30: -77.32) when compared to pre-operative SFI (SFI: -4.44). However, in this group, SFI improvement was observed at 60 and 90 post-operative days (SFI-60: -73.40; SFI-90: - 71.10). Similarly, in the NGVC group, a sudden worsening of the SFI was observed after surgery (SFI-30: -71.65), with a gradual recovery at 60 and 90 post- operative days (SFI-60: - 59.37 and SFI-90: -49.77). In the NGVCP group, after an abrupt worsening of the SFI (SFI- 30: -75.27), an improvement was also observed at 60 (SFI-60: -69.09) and 90 (SFI-90: -65.83) post-operative days. Groups were compared to determine statistical significance using one-way ANOVA, and significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) were found between the Sham group and the NG, NGVC, and NGVCP groups. Furthermore, the SFI-90 values were significantly different (p=0.029) and were better for the NGVC group in comparison to the NG group. While the NGVCP group showed a gradual improvement in SFI, this was not significantly different when compared to the NG and NGVC groups throughout the assessment period (Table 1 and Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(6).png\" width=\"376\" height=\"441\" /></p>\r\n<p>SFI index is presented for 0, 30, 60, and 90 days after surgery.

Large caliber myelinated fibers were observed, as well as preservation of endoneurial space. No signs of Wallerian degeneration were observed, and fascicles presented normal morphology. On the other hand, morphological alterations in nerve fascicles were observed in samples from the NG, NGVC, NGVCP groups, as evidenced by loss of large caliber myelinated fibers and the predominance of small caliber myelinated fibers, which suggests axonal budding. In these three groups, signs of Wallerian degeneration were also observed (Figure 3). The Sham group showed a myelinated fiber density per area of 41.68 &plusmn; 5.39, fiber diameter of 11.53 &plusmn; 0.34 &micro;m, axon diameter of 6.22 &plusmn; 0.23 &micro;m, and sheath thickness of 2.65 &plusmn; 0.17 &micro;m.

No significant difference was found between the NGVC group and the NGVCP (p=0.83). However, the comparison of the NG and NGVCP groups (p=0.005) and of the NG and NGVC groups (p=0.001) presented both a significant statistical difference, since the myelinated fiber density was increased in the NGVC and the NGVCP groups. Mean nerve fiber diameter was 7.76 &plusmn; 0.27 mm in the NG group, 6.25 &plusmn; 1.05 mm in the NGVC group, and 5.35 &plusmn; 0.8 mm in the NGVCP group.

Repair of large and complex nerve losses usually require nerve grafting [18]. Improvement of post-operative functional results is a current challenge faced by physicians and researchers [19]. Although some recovery of functional nerve capacity can currently be achieved, we are far from reaching an ideal solution for peripheral nerve reconstruction [20]. Following a report by Chiu and colleagues [21], in which autogenous vein graft was used as conduit for nerve regeneration in animal models, several clinical studies have showed that small vein segments could serve as conduits for nerve regeneration in humans [22,23]. Vein grafts provide a favorable microenvironment for axonal regeneration as well as serving as a biological barrier against scar tissue invasion [24]. Piskin et al. [25] reported that synthetic conduits interfere with regeneration inside the tubes. Natural conduits offer several advantages including abundant donor sites for autogenous vein graft, absence of deficits upon removal, low cost, and a lack of immunological implications. As described by Wang et al. [26], Ferrari et al.[8], Gravvanis et al.[27], and Jeon et al.[28], we opted to place the vein conduit inside-out (everted), aiming to maintain a collagen-rich adventitia in the inside of the tube, and thus favor nerve regeneration.</p>\r\n<p>Nerve regeneration is stimulated by growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF- &szlig;1), which stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells [29,30]. Vein conduits release neurotrophic factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) [7,8]. In this study, we used platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), which forms a stiff membrane that remains intact for up to 7 days and allows the slow release of growth factors, as previously described by Dohan et al. [31]. The gradual release of growth factors constitutes an advantage of PRF over platelet-rich plasma (PRP), because growth factors in PRP are released during the first hours and completely dissolved within approximately 3 days [32]. Among other PRF advantages are the low cost and ease of preparation, making it a reasonable product for clinical use. In the study by Kim Yeong et al. [33], the authors used rats with 10-mm long sciatic nerve defects to compare the effects of autologous nerve graft, inside-out vein grafts, and inside- out vein grafts filled with PRP on SFI. Similar to our results, that study showed that SFI at 90 days post-surgery ranged from -60 to -80. In that study, the group with PRP pre- filled vein conduits had a mean SFI-90 of -65, compared to our results in which SFI-90 was - 49 for the NGVC and -65 for the NGVCP groups. Furthermore, in our study, the SFI-90 of the NG group was -71, comparable to an SFI-90 of -60 obtained by Kim Yeong et al. In the Lichtenfels study [34], the use of autologous nerve graft, saline solution pre-filled silicone tube, silicone tube with PRP, and silicone tube with PRF were compared to evaluate the repair of a 10-mm gap. Their SFI-90 results were different from ours in autologous nerve graft (-42.39 &plusmn; 10.348 versus -71 &plusmn; 4.8 in our study), but the SFI-90 they observed for PRP (- 55.86 &plusmn; 11.2) and PRF (-53.5 &plusmn; 11.88) pre-filled tubes were similar to the NGVC (-49 &plusmn; 22) and NGVCP (-65 &plusmn; 6.2) groups in our study.</p>\r\n<p>In previous studies, different models of nerve loss have been used, making the comparison among studies challenging. Regardless of gap size, the SFI-60 of our NG group was similar to that reported by Oliveira et al. [35] (5- mm gap, SFI-60: -83.46), Rafiuddin et al. [36] (10 mm gap, SFI-60: -79.9), and Sabongi et. Al [20] (8-mm gap, SFI-60: -76.4). Our results show that the adjuvant methods used to assist nerve damage repair were unable to restore the SFI values to those seen in the Sham control group. However, compared to the NG group, animals in the NGVC group displayed a statistically significant improvement at post-2.6 to 4.1 &micro;m found in our study. Finally, myelin sheath thickness also exhibited variations between studies, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 &micro;m in the Lichtenfels et al. [34] study and 1.3 to 1.7 &micro;m in our study. In this study, morphologic and morphometric analysis showed that the NG group showed a significantly greater nerve fiber diameter and axon diameter when compared to NGVC and NGVCP groups, and significantly greater myelin sheath thickness compared to the NGVCP group. This analysis showed that the increase in fiber density in the NGVC and NGVCP groups was due to axonal sprouting resulting from the nerve injury. The increase in number of fibers was attributed to the large number of small caliber fibers. The NGVC group presented a significant increase in fiber density when compared to Sham and NG groups, with no difference when compared to NGVCP group. The number of fibers is known to increase considerably up to 3 months after nerve injury, plateau after 6 to 9 months, and return to basal levels after 1 year [14,37]. Similar to observations in previous studies [38,39], our data does not support an association between SFI and morphometric analysis. G-ratio, defined as the ratio between axon diameter and fiber diameter, was 0.53 for the Sham control group, 0.52 for the NG group, 0.47 for the NGVC group, and 0.48 for the NGVCP group. The normal reference value for the G-ratio is close to 0.6, which maximizes nervous conduction. On the other hand, a value close to zero is indicative of axonal atrophy, and demyelination is suggested by a G- ratio value close to 1 [37,40].</p>\r\n<p>The  number  of  motor  neurons  in  the  ante&reg;rior  horn operative day 90, which may suggest advancement in the of the spinal cord was assessed by Fluoro-Gold staining. surgical technique used to repair severe nerve injuries to achieve better functional results. This improvement may be explained by the vein&rsquo;s release of factors, or by the vein itself serving as a conduit for axonal reorientation. The NGVCP group, on the other hand, did not show the same improvement, and this may be explained for the fact that the PRF factors released were not as effective as expected. In the Kim Yeong et al. [33] study, histological analysis at week 8 showed a myelin sheath thickness in the autologous graft group of 0.9 &plusmn; 0.21 &micro;m, compared to 1.7 &plusmn; 0.8 &micro;m for our NG group. Axon diameter values also diverged between Kim et al.&rsquo;s autologous nerve graft group (2.9 &plusmn; 0.73 &micro;m) and the NG group in our study (4.1 &plusmn; 0.4 &micro;m). However, the remaining groups presented similar myelin sheath and axon diameter values between the two studies.</p>\r\n<p>Histomorphometric analyses reported by Lichtenfels et al. 34, performed at 12 weeks, showed no statistically significant difference in axonal diameter and myelin sheath thickness among experimental groups (p = 0.05) despite their suggestion that PRP and PRF exerted a positive effect on functional nerve recovery. Among groups, axonal diameter varied from 3 to 4 &micro;m, which is similar to the variation of While there was no significant difference between the NG, NGVC, and NGVCP groups, our data showed statistically significant differences between those groups and the Sham control group. The number of positively labeled cells can represent the degree of nerve reconnection to the spinal cord, and is considered an ideal method to assess nerve function [37].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Compared to the Sham control group, all experimental groups exhibited a statistically significant decrease in the functional and histomorphometric analyzed parameters. The NGVC group showed a statistically significant functional improvement in SFI-90 when compared to the NG group. This improvement may be explained by the veins release of factors, or the vein itself serving as a conduit for axonal reorientation. Although a significant improvement was expected with the use of PRF, it was verified that the release of factors from this substance, in this case, was not so effective.

More than 60% of the patients with MM have shown evidence of gastrointestinal metastasis at autopsy and only 1-4% of these patients will have a clinical manifestation. Therefore, acute bowel obstruction due to this entity is rare. Case Presentation: We report a case of an acute bowel obstruction in a 51-year-old patient with a history of resection of cutaneous melanoma with lymphatic mapping and metastasis in one node 3 years ago. Laparotomy with enterectomy of the affected segment was performed. Histopathologic examination was compatible with metastasis of cutaneous melanoma. We update some considerations about this unusual form of presentation. Conclusions: Small bowel obstruction due to cutaneous melanoma metastasis is an infrequent form of presentation with only a few cases described. Special attention should be taken in patients with medical records of melanoma and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Acute abdomen; Cutaneous malignant melanoma; Intestinal metastasis; Small bowel obstruction</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Background</h3>\r\n<p>Malignant melanoma (MM) incidence has been increasing rapidly in the recent years, at an overall rate of 33% for men and 23% women from 2002 to 2006, accounting 1-3% of cancers in the USA [1,2]. Furthermore, there is an increase in reported cases of small bowel melanoma metastasis due to its preference to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract, being the most common extra abdominal source of small bowel metastasis. Up to 60% patients with MM will have evidence of Gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis at autopsy and only 1-4% of these patients will have a clinical manifestation [2-5]. Even though its low incidence, surgeons must take into consideration this form of presentation in patients with an acute abdomen and a history of MM.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Case Presentation</h3>\r\n<p>A 51-year-old Caucasian male patient with a history of resection of cutaneous melanoma in the lumbar region with lymphatic mapping. Histopathologic report informed metastasis of melanoma in one node, and nivolumab as adjuvant treatment was indicated which concluded in January 2020. He was admitted in our hospital with a history of a diffuse abdominal pain for the past 5 months that became progressively worse in the last 24 hours. Physical examination revealed moderate abdominal distension with pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Blood tests were normal. Due to its medical records and the clinical presentation, a CT scan was requested that showed an evident intestinal loop thickening with areas of necrosis, mesenteric lymphadenopathies and hepatic nodes consistent with metastases (Figure 1). Based on these findings urgent laparotomy was decided and an exophytic, pigmented, 8cm tumor was found that invaded the small intestine at 130cm from the angle of Traits (Figure 2). Enlarged of mesenteric lymph nodes and solid hepatic lesions were also observed. Resection of the affected intestine with end-to-end anastomosis was performed, and a liver biopsy was also carried out. Histopathology examination revealed infiltration of the intestinal wall and liver parenchyma by malignant cells with melanin pigmentation and necrosis areas, consistent with cutaneous melanoma metastasis (Figure 3). The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 5th postoperative day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure1(9).png\" width=\"717\" height=\"498\" /></p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 1:</b> CT-scan showing marked ileal loop thickening with areas of necrosis, mesenteric lymphadenopathies and hepatic nodules consistent with metastases.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure2(6).png\" width=\"666\" height=\"499\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 2:</b> Surgical specimen showing an exophytic, pigmented tumor invading the small intestine.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/figure3(5).png\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 3:</b> Histopathology examination revealed infiltration of the intestinal wall and liver parenchyma by malignant cells with melanin pigmentation and necrosis areas, consistent with cutaneous melanoma metastasis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Malignant Melanoma is the most common source of GI metastases and most of them rely in the small bowel [2-5]. However, its course is usually free of symptoms and bowel complications are infrequent. In concordance, it has been reported that 60% of patients who die from MM probable have GI metastasis, but only a small group, around 1-4%, will have a clinical manifestation. The period observed between the excision of the primary cutaneous melanoma and the GI metastasis varies according to literature, between 2 to 180 months [3-6].</p>\r\n<p>Reported clinical manifestations are heterogeneous, including nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, intra- abdominal bleeding or digestive hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, and obstruction. The latter one being the less common cause of acute abdomen pain with only a few cases reported in the literature [3,5,7,8]. Computed tomography is the preferred modality of choice in diagnosis, and operative management is considered the standard of care when symptoms are present. Definitive diagnosis of melanoma metastasis can only be obtained when bowel resection is performed [9].</p>\r\n<p>It is well described in the literature that surgical excision of GI MM metastasis improves quality of life and survival, and complete resection of the tumor with free surgical margins might substantially improve prognosis in selected cases [4, 5]. However, emergency surgery has been suggested as a negative factor and most patients usually have widespread metastasis at presentation. In our case, the patient dead 4 months after surgery due to disease progression.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Small bowel obstruction due to cutaneous melanoma metastasis is an uncommon. Albeit this, its incidence is increasing owing to the avidity of this tumor for the GI tract. Surgeons should consider this form of presentation as a differential diagnosis in patients with a history of melanoma presenting with an acute abdomen.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1100753-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Swetter MS, Thompson JA, Albertini MR, et al.

Methods: This study was conducted to show the attitude of Syrian society against the monkeypox virus by spreading an online questionnaire to study the percentage of Syrians&rsquo; concern and worries about this disease globally and locally. Results: The results of the questionnaire were discussed from the following points of view: the percentage of people afraid of monkeypox spreading, reasons why people are afraid of monkeypox, the percentage of people who expect monkeypox to become a pandemic, The percentage of people who think that the Syrian health system will be able to deal with this disease, and source of information about monkeypox. Discussion: There is a good percentage of Syrians that are worried and afraid of the turning of monkeypox into a pandemic and its spread in Syria. Therefore, several steps should be taken in order to prevent the outbreak of monkeypox in Syria, and the role of the public health profession in Syria must be empowered in order to face this disease.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Monkeypox; Syrian society; Attitude; Questionnaire</p>', '<p>Monkeypox is a rare viral disease caused by the Monkeypox virus of the Orthopox virus genus. Many viruses also belong to this genus as well, such as the common smallpox virus and cowpox virus. The first case of monkeypox infection in humans was discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from which the virus spread in central and western African countries, and since then there have been global efforts to limit the spread of this virus and deal with it [1].</p>\r\n<p>In May 2022, a global outbreak of monkeypox was observed in several countries, which raised the concern of people and the World Health Organization.</p>\r\n<p>The incubation period for monkeypox virus usually ranges between 7-14 days, but it may extend up to 21 days. Symptoms usually begin with fever accompanied by headache and fatigue, muscle, back pain, and enlarged lymph nodes, and then the rash usually appears after the second or third day of the fever appearance. The symptoms usually last from 2 to 4 weeks [3, 4].</p>\r\n<p>The monkeypox virus can enter the human body through the skin, respiratory system, and mucous membranes, through contact with an infected animal or through eating its meat. The infection is transmitted between humans through large droplets secreted from the respiratory system of an infected person or by long-term contact with an infected person such as having sex with [5-7].</p>\r\n<p>Doctors have determined, by studying the disease in Africa, that the death rate does not exceed 10%, but there is currently no effective and safe qualitative treatment for monkeypox, and this is what worries people, but some research indicates that the smallpox vaccine may provide a good prevention rate [8,9].</p>\r\n<p>Prevention methods of the virus include avoiding contact with animals that may be infected with the virus, such as rodents. Avoiding contact with any materials that have been in contact with an infected animal or person. Keeping hands hygiene after contact with infected animals or humans by washing hands with soap and water, or using an alcohol-based sanitizer [10, 11].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Objectives</h3>\r\n<p>We aimed at knowing the extent of anxiety and worry in the Syrian society about the spread of monkeypox and explaining the reason for this fear, and highlighting the role of social media in influencing people\'s psychological health through the dissemination of medical rumours or spreading awareness, in addition to proposing some measures to be taken in Syria to prevent the spread of the disease, as the Syrian health system will not be able to control the disease if it enters Syria.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<p>An online questionnaire was designed and spread among 493 participants from the Syrian community through emails and different social media between 25 and 27 May 2022, to study the extent of anxiety among people in Syria that was caused by monkeypox spreading lately. The questionnaire includes the following sections: Participant\'s age {participants were categorized in 6 groups as per their adopted age ranges (15-25, 25-35, 35-45, 45-55, 55-56 and &lt; 65 years&gt;)} and provinces (Damascus, RifDimshq, Hama, Homs, Aleepo, Lattakia, Tartous, Idlib, As-Suwayda, Daraa, Al Hasakah, Deir Ez-zor, Al-Raqqa, and Quneitra Governorate).</p>\r\n<p>Then they were asked if they are worried about monkeypox spreading, and what they are worried about from its spreading (they were allowed to choose more than one answer), and if they think that monkeypox will be a new pandemic, and if they think that the Syrian health system will be able to deal with monkeypox if it spreads in Syria, then they were asked how did they hear about monkeypox.</p>\r\n<p>The online questionnaire questions were based on a similar article, which was about a study conducted in South Nigeria to study the extent to which people know about monkeypox [2].</p>\r\n<p>We used Google Form platform to create and distribute the questionnaire to a range of the Syrian population, then the results were analysed and a descriptive statistic was conducted, then the data charts were made using Microsoft Excel 2013.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Design</h3>\r\n<p>A cross-sectional study was conducted and a questionnaire was distributed to a sample of the Syrian population (different ages and governorates), to study the extent of anxiety and fear in Syrian society about the spread of monkeypox virus.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Distribution of participants according to age:</h3>\r\n<p>The participants were in the age group of 15-25 years (170: 34.5%) while the &lt; 65 years (6: 1.2%) seemed to be the minimum. The rest of participants were between 25-35, 35-45, 45-55 and 55-65 years, with their numbers recognized as 155 (31.4%), 102 (20.7%), 40 (8.1%), 20 (4.1%) respectively (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 1:</b> Categorization of participants as per their age.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Distribution of participants according to the provinces:</h3>\r\n<p>The participants of the two provinces Damascus and Damascene countryside were observed maximally of 45.6% (225), while the Eastern region\'s participants (Al-Raqqa, Dier ez-zour, Al-Hasakah) were minimal of 1.6% (8) of the total participants, the coastal region provinces of Lattakia and Tartous, were observed with 19.1% (95) participants followed by central region (Homs and Hama) 17.6% (87), the northern region (Aleppo and Idlib) 12.8% (63) and the southern region (Daraa, Suwayda, Quneitra) 3.2% (16) (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 2:</b> Participant&rsquo;s percentage according to the provinces.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Percentage of people that are afraid of monkeypox spreading</h3>\r\n<p>The participants were asked whether they were afraid of monkeypox spreading or not. Most participants (39.69% .N: 197) were worried and afraid about this disease. While (37.69%. N: 187) of them were not worried or afraid of the disease, and (22.8%. N: 113) of them were never concerned about diseases and pandemics (Figure 3).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 3:</b> Percentage of people that are afraid of monkeypox spreading.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Reasons why people are afraid of monkeypox:</h3>\r\n<p>The participants were asked what are the reasons for their worries and fear of monkeypox spreading and they were allowed to choose more than one answer. The data indicate that the main reason is people\'s doubt about the ability of the Syrian health system to address this disease (42.5%. N: 99), and the second common reason was that people do not know much about this disease, but it worries them anyway because of the news they heard about it (41.6%. N: 97), then the data showed that the reason which comes in third place was that there is no specific treatment for this disease and it may result in a large number of deaths if it enters Syria (28.4%. N: 66), and some people said that they have other reasons for their worries (19.3%. N: 45). Finally, a few people said that they are suffering from chronic diseases and worried about their health from this disease (8.2%. N: 19) (Figure 4).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 4:</b> Percentage of reasons that made Syrian people afraid of monkeypox.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Percentage of people who expect monkeypox to become a pandemic:</h3>\r\n<p>The participants were questioned if they expected that monkeypox would become a new pandemic soon, about half of participants, 49.5% (244), were not sure if it would be a pandemic or not, so they answered that maybe it would, while 36.1% (178) said yes, they think it will be a new pandemic soon, and some of them 14.4% (71) were optimistic and answered no it will not (Figure 5).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 5:</b> Percentage of people who expect monkeypox to become a pandemic.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Percentage of people who think that the Syrian health system will be able to deal with this disease:</h3>\r\n<p>Participants\' opinions were taken about whether they think that the Syrian health system will be able to deal with this disease when it enters Syria. Unfortunately, more than half of the participants, 52.1% (257), did not believe in the ability of the Syrian health system to deal with the disease correctly if it entered Syria and answered no, while 29.6% (146) were not sure if the Syrian health system can deal with this disease and answered maybe, and few people 18.3% (90) ,believe in the ability of the Syrian health system and said yes (Figure 6).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 6:</b> Percentage of people who think that the Syrian health system will be able to deal with monkeypox.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Source of information about monkeypox:</h3>\r\n<p>Majorly, 87% (428) of the participants were informed about monkeypox from social media and internet platforms, and some of them 10.7% (53) heard of it from the news on televisions and radio. Finally, only 2.4% (11) mentioned that they heard about this disease from their families and friends (Figure 7).</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 7:</b> Source of information about monkeypox</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>The current global outbreak of monkeypox virus infection in humans suggests changes in biologic aspects of the virus and changes in human behavior, such changes might be driven by waning smallpox immunity, relaxation of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) prevention measures, resumption of international travel, and sexual interactions associated with large gatherings.</p>\r\n<p>We noticed from the results of the questionnaire that there is a good percentage of Syrians worried and afraid of the turning of monkeypox into a pandemic and its spread in Syria, as the Syrians have suffered a lot in the COVID-19 pandemic and have lost many victims and no one wants to repeat this scenario. The Syrian health system, no matter how strong it is, will not be able to prevent the disease if it spreads in the country.</p>\r\n<p>And by comparing our results with the results of a previous study conducted in southern Nigeria in 2020 to study the extent of people&rsquo;s knowledge of monkeypox and the effect of medical rumors that spread about this disease on social media and among people, it was found that most people in Nigeria had little or no knowledge of the disease, while in Syria there was a greater percentage of people who knew basic information about this disease, and in the two studies it was found that most people&rsquo;s information about monkeypox came from social media, which makes the spread of medical rumors and misinformation easy and widespread in both Syrian and Nigerian societies which is an obstacle to medical awareness campaigns to achieve its intended purpose [2].</p>\r\n<p>There are several steps that should be taken in order to prevent the outbreak of monkeypox in Syria. The most important step is to secure the smallpox vaccine for citizens and to start national vaccination campaigns and give the vaccine to the largest possible number of people, as the vaccine provides a very good rate of prevention from monkeypox, and then issuing laws that commit people to physical distancing from each other in crowded places such as public transport and places of worship in order to reduce the chances of physical contact between people as much as possible. Organizing awareness campaigns in schools about the importance of washing hands with soap and water, especially after touching animals or using alcohol disinfectant, launching awareness campaigns in the Syrian countryside, in order not to contact with animals that can transmit the virus, such as rodents, as the Syrian countryside is constantly dealing with these animals. Finally, the role of the public health profession in Syria must be empowered for its large and important role in dealing with any health disaster or new pandemic, as Syria suffers from severe shortages of this specialization due to the war.</p>\r\n<p>The questionnaire also showed us the importance of controlling fake news on social media, so people must be aware and teach them how to take correct and reliable information from social media platforms away from rumours and fake news illusions.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>This study with the previous questionnaire showed us that the monkeypox is a disease that we should be aware of and take seriously, and it showed the impact of social media on people at different ages and how they deal with news related to diseases and pandemics.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Limitations and Challenges</h3>\r\n<p>The difficulties that we faced during our study were limited to our inability to analyse the results in a quick time due to the lack of statistics about monkeypox disease during the past ten years.</p>\r\n<p>We also encountered some difficulties in convincing a large segment of people to express their opinion about the disease because they do not know much about it.</p>\r\n<p>We were able to face these obstacles by using statistics from the World Health Organization and articles by some researchers to get the information we need about monkeypox, we also provided relevant information to some participants who did not know much about the disease.</p>\r\n<p><b>Authors Statement:</b> This research is a purely individual activity by the authors and is not funded by any organization (governmental or non-governmental), and it does not need ethical approval, since all the participants of the questionnaire have been informed previously that the questionnaire is intended for research purposes and that their answers will be shared as results in this research and they agreed on that.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1.	<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007791\" target=\"_blank\"> M.

PCOS is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  The treatment of PCOS is primarily focused on symptom reduction and modestly on moderation of the associated insulin resistance. This review provides an overview of the newest data-supported prescription, pharmaceutical agents, utilized in women with PCOS, to address the metabolic abnormalities commonly associated with this condition that increase CVD.  While metformin has a long history of use in PCOS, its weight and CV risk reduction is modest and the use of oral contraceptives (COC) is limited by adverse effects most notable being the increased incidence of venous thromboembolism and migraines, and by additional risk factors such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. The ideal treatment of PCOS related metabolic dysfunction should reduce insulin resistance and glucose intolerance/T2DMM, obesity, and dyslipidemia, thereby ameliorating the serious long-term CV consequences impacting a large percentage of women with PCOS. This article provides a review of the prominent pharmaceuticals prescribed for use in women with PCOS to address cardiometabolic dysfunction.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Abbreviations</h3>\r\n<p>CV &ndash; Cardiovascular</p>\r\n<p>CVD &ndash; cardiovascular disease</p>\r\n<p>COC- Combined oral contraceptives</p>\r\n<p>DHEAS- Dehydroepiandrosterone</p>\r\n<p>DPP-4- Dipeptidyl peptidase-4</p>\r\n<p>EE- Ethynylestradiol</p>\r\n<p>FBG- Fasting blood glucose</p>\r\n<p>FSH-Follicle stimulating hormone</p>\r\n<p>GIT- Glucose intolerance</p>\r\n<p>GLP-1- Glucagon-like peptide-1</p>\r\n<p>HDL-C &ndash; High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol</p>\r\n<p>HOMA- Homeostasis model assessment</p>\r\n<p>IR- Insulin resistance</p>\r\n<p>LH- Luteinizing hormone</p>\r\n<p>LDL &ndash; Low-density Lipoprotein</p>\r\n<p>MS- Metabolic syndrome</p>\r\n<p>MI- Myocardial Infarction</p>\r\n<p>PCOS- polycystic ovarian syndrome</p>\r\n<p>RCT- Randomized Controlled Trial</p>\r\n<p>SGLT-2- Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2</p>\r\n<p>SHBG- Sex hormone binding globulin</p>\r\n<p>T2DM &ndash; Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</p>\r\n<p>TC- Total cholesterol</p>\r\n<p>TGs-Triglycerides</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Management of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</h3>\r\n<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 15&ndash;20 percent [1]. PCOS is defined by hyperandrogenism, menstrual abnormalities such as oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhea, and ultrasound-detected polycystic ovaries [2]. Additionally, PCOS is associated with a wide range of serious metabolic dysfunctions, including insulin resistance (IR), endothelial dysfunction, and obesity. These underlying metabolic abnormalities results in a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, metabolic syndrome (MS), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [2]. MS is substantially more prevalent in women with PCOS than in the general population, with an incidence of 40%&ndash;50% [3]. Patients with PCOS commonly manifest an atherogenic lipid profile, with increased total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride levels (TG) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels [4], [5]. The etiology of PCOS is complex and multifactorial (figure 1), including a genetic component and a high prevalence of IR, which contributes to the foundational, underlying problem of women with PCOS - disordered folliculogenesis [6]. Although more common in heavier women with PCOS, IR is prevalent in all women with PCOS, regardless of BMI. A better predictor than BMI of IR in women with PCOS is their waist circumference [7], [8].</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 1:</b> Illustration of the pathophysiology of polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>\r\n<p>CVD= Cardiovascular disease; LH=Luteinizing Harmone; FSH- Follicular Stimulating Hormone; HTN=Hypertension; NAFLD= Non Alcoholic Fatty Acid Disease; PCOS= Polycystic ovarian syndrome</p>\r\n<p>The management of PCOS has traditionally been primarily symptom focused, with only minimal attention placed on the myriad serious, metabolic consequences of this complex condition.  Treating the metabolic consequences of PCOS, thereby lowering the risk of the long-term consequences of metabolic dysfunction, should be the primary focus of any PCOS therapy. (Figure 2) Although lifestyle modifications remain the first-line treatment for PCOS [9], [10], for many, at least initially, pharmaceutical therapeutics provide additional benefits. Studies have shown that a 5%&ndash;10% weight loss with exercise favorably impact the metabolic and clinical profiles of PCOS women.

Several newer agents, within several pharmaceutical classes, have been shown to positively impact metabolic dysfunction, successfully aiding in significant weight reduction and potentially reducing long-term CV complications.</p>\r\n<p><b>Figure 2:</b> Treatment modalities in polycystic ovarian syndrome</p>\r\n<p>COCs/OCPs- Combined oral contraceptives; DDP4= Dipeptidyl peptidase-4; GLP-1= Glucagon-like peptide-1; SGLT 2= Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2; PCOS= polycystic ovarian syndrome; TZD= Thiazolidinedione</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Metformin:</h3>\r\n<p>Metformin is a second line treatment and is generally used when lifestyle modifications alone are insufficient or have failed, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The daily doses of oral metformin in PCOS treatment range from 500 mg to 2550 mg [2].  Metformin use produces modest weight reduction over a one- to two-year period of 4-7 pounds, with significant individual variation [16]. Despite these unspectacular results, some benefits may be seen. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 52 PCOS women demonstrated that metformin significantly decreased weight and BMI compared to pioglitazone [17].  Another study [18] assessed the effects of low dose metformin (500 mg twice daily) and rosiglitazone for 3 months in PCOS women and found reduced follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin levels in both groups. Metformin improved endothelial dysfunction in PCOS women independent of changes in glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, or presence of diabetes in one study [19]. However, another study [20] found no change in endothelial function following 3 months of metformin therapy in PCOS patients. The differing outcomes could be explained by the fact that the first trial included obese participants on metformin for 6 months, while the shorter 3-month study of metformin evaluated lean PCOS women. Several other studies [21]&ndash; [23] showed improvement of macrovascular flow mediated dilation in PCOS with metformin, and a recent meta-analysis showed that metformin can reduce TC, LDL-C levels, and TGs in non-diabetic adults [24]. Other insulin sensitizing agents should be considered, given the modest weight reduction and gastrointestinal intolerance with metformin, in addition to the data showing newer medications additionally can lower CVD events.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Analogs:</h3>\r\n<p>Incretin hormones, including the enterocyte produced GLP-1, promote glucose-dependent insulin secretion, most notably after meals [25]. Impairment of the incretin action is evident in IR and T2DM and reduced in patients with PCOS [26]. As IR is highly prevalent in PCOS, harnessing the therapeutic benefits of GLP-1 agonists seems plausible [27]. According to a recent study conducted by Yaribeygi et al., these agents may impact insulin sensitivity by affecting eight distinct molecular pathways, including inflammatory, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, glucose transporter 4 expression/translation and insulin signaling [28].</p>\r\n<p>Liraglutide\'s impact on weight reduction in obese and overweight PCOS individuals (n=84) was explored in a single observational trial. Liraglutide given as daily subcutaneous injection (starting dose of 0.6 mg, daily increment to 1.2 mg, and 1.8 mg if tolerated) for 4 weeks and followed for over 27 weeks (mean duration of treatment 27.8 weeks), showed a significant reduction in weight and BMI [29]. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of GLP-1 agonists and metformin in PCOS women, GLP-1 agonists were shown to produce substantial improvements in insulin sensitivity, lowering BMI, and reducing abdominal girth, when compared to metformin [30]. Similar trials reported favorable weight loss and reduced testosterone levels, but no significant impact on insulin levels or sensitivity were demonstrated [31], [32].</p>\r\n<p>Liraglutide use resulted in a substantial weight reduction, and improved atherothrombotic indicators such as endothelial function and clotting in another trial [33]. Liraglutide enhances glycemic control in individuals with T2DM (HbA1c lowered by 1.5%) [34] and reduces CVD risk, as shown in the LEADER study [35].  Data shows that semaglutide and exenatide, two other GLP 1 agonist, aid in weight reduction [35], [36]. A higher dose of semaglutide, given as a weekly injection, has been FDA approved for weight loss.  Side effects of semaglutide include an increased risk of pancreatitis and gastrointestinal side effects.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors:</h3>\r\n<p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin) are oral second and third line anti-hyperglycemic agents used for the treatment of T2DM [37].  Their mechanism of action is the inhibiting of DPP-4 &ndash; a ubiquitous enzyme responsible for the degradation of internally produced GLP-1 [38]. Sitagliptin was found to lower the glucose response to an oral glucose tolerance test, and to reduce visceral fat in a double-blind study [39]. Sitagliptin improved &szlig;-cell function (homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function, (HOMA-B)) and insulin sensitivity in a study that assessed it as a viable therapeutic option for metformin-intolerant PCOS patients [40]. In an animal study, sitagliptin reduced FBG, lowered androgen levels, and improved ovarian fibrosis in the rat model of PCOS [41]. Headache, and pharyngitis are the most often reported side effects of gliptins [42] and hypersensitivity reactions, although uncommon, have been reported with saxagliptin [43].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor:</h3>\r\n<p>Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) are a class of oral medications used in T2DM management. SGLT-2 inhibitors block SGLT-2 in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, reducing glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose elimination [44].  They [28] improve glycemic parameters via multiple molecular pathways [45]. SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly utilized for their important role in the treatment of obesity, augmenting their CV and renal benefits [46].   Another positive is weight loss, averaging 2&ndash;4 kg [47]. 60&ndash;70% of the overall weight loss seen with dapagliflozin was due to a decrease in fat mass and body water fat [48], [49].</p>\r\n<p>In recent PCOS studies, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated very encouraging results. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of empagliflozin vs metformin in obese PCOS women, empagliflozin therapy resulted in substantial improvements in anthropometric parameters and body composition, despite no changes in metabolic parameters [50], suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors would offer PCOS women significant benefits. A 24-week trial found that empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) reduced HbA1c (&ndash;1.43% and &ndash;1.44%) compared to placebo in T2DM patients (EMPA-REGMONO) [51]. Likewise, in a 24-week T2DM trial (EMPA-REG-PIO), empagliflozin with pioglitazone showed a substantial decrease in FBG and HbA1c compared to placebo [52].</p>\r\n<p>The EMPA-REG-OUTCOME study evaluated 7020 T2DM patients with known CVD. Empagliflozin significantly decreased the main composite outcome (MACE) of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke [34], [35]. In the CANVAS study (n= 10,142 T2DM patients), the main outcome (MACE) was lowered by 14% in high-risk individuals [53]. It also showed renal benefits - reducing the decline in eGFR by 40%, renal mortality by 25%, and the progression to albuminuria by 25% [53]. Similar renal protective benefits were reported in the canagliflozin study (CREDENCE), with a 34% decrease in renal composite outcomes, including end-stage renal failure and renal mortality [54]. While the DECLARE-TIMI trials (for dapagliflozin) did not reveal a meaningful impact on MACE, it did indicate a reduction in CVD mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [55]. Genitourinary tract infections, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, were the most reported side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors [34].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Thiazolidinedione:</h3>\r\n<p>Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist thiazolidinedione. Pioglitazone increases peripheral glucose absorption, improves IR, hyperandrogenemia, and ovulatory dysfunction in PCOS patients [56]. In a RCT of PCOS women, pioglitazone was tested against placebo. Pioglitazone reduced fasting serum insulin and the free androgen index, while increasing sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels [57]. Pioglitazone also showed considerable improvements in ovulation and menstrual cycles [58] in a meta-analysis comparing metformin with pioglitazone for PCOS. Another RCT investigating pioglitazone, metformin, and orlistat, concluded that mean IR and its biological variability were significantly reduced [59]. Despite its favorable impact on metabolic parameters in PCOS women, its use has largely been limited due to the weight gain from fluid retention [60]</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Spironolactone:</h3>\r\n<p>Spironolactone is a commonly used antiandrogen for the treatment of hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, and acne in PCOS patients. It inhibits the action of aldosterone on mineralocorticoid receptors, competes with dihydrotestosterone for binding to androgen receptors, increases SHBG, and lowers LH-stimulated androgen production by reducing gonadotropin releasing hormone and LH levels. It is commonly prescribed in divided daily doses, totally 100-200 mg daily [61]. 6-12 treatment with Spironolactone enhanced lipid profiles and reversed endothelial dysfunction in non-obese PCOS patients [62]. Additionally, it improved vascular compliance in both pre- and postmenopausal PCOS women [63]. Aldosterone can impair endothelial function through increased NADPH oxidase activity and mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species, which decrease bioavailability of nitric oxide. Mazzaet al [64] found that low dose spironolactone (25 mg daily) significantly reduced hirsutism and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels when compared to metformin alone. Another RCT [65] reported similar findings. Hagag et al [66] demonstrated that spironolactone-norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol was an effective combination for the treatment of hirsutism in PCOS, with favorable influence on lipids and indices of low-grade inflammation. A RCT [67] found that combining COC with spironolactone was more effective than metformin in reducing hirsutism score, free testosterone, androstenedione, DHEAS, and menstrual dysfunction, however, no differences in blood pressure, abnormal glucose tolerance or dyslipidemia were observed. Hyperkalemia, headaches, breast tenderness, intermenstrual spotting are potential side effects of spironolactone. Because spironolactone\'s teratogenicity might result in inadequate masculinization of male genitalia, contraception is strongly recommended [61]. However, large RCTs are required to further elucidate the cardiovascular benefits of spironolactone in PCOS women.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Acarbose:</h3>\r\n<p>Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that reduces intestinal glucose absorption, thereby decreasing postprandial wave and insulin peak [68]. In a RCT [69], 150 mg/day of acarbose for 6 months resulted in a decreased BMI, free androgen index, and FBG, while improving menstrual regularity and SHBG concentration in obese PCOS women compared to placebo. Another RCT assessing the CV effects of acarbose demonstrated a decrease in BMI, blood pressure, and TGs. A meta-analysis [70] showed that acarbose use was associated with 35% reduction in CV risk.  The risk of diabetes progression decreased by 36% in the STOP-NIDMM trial [71]. Gastrointestinal intolerance such as diarrhea, bloating, and the stomach discomfort are frequent side effects.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pramlintide:</h3>\r\n<p>Preptin is a peptide secreted from pancreatic beta cells, along with insulin, in response to glucose. Preptin is believed to be a physiological stimulant of insulin secretion, with increased output during hyper&not;insulinemic conditions [72]. A meta-analysis [73] involving 8 RCTs, observed that pramlintide was associated with a small reduction in HbA1c, and a modest reduction in weight in patients with T2DM. Although there are no specific studies with PCOS women, it may have benefits with that population, due to its reduction of HgbA1C and favorable weight loss properties.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Statins:</h3>\r\n<p>Statins have been studied in PCOS women. Simvastatin (20 mg) combined with a COC showed improvements in lipid profile and testosterone levels compared to COC alone [74]. To test the efficacy of statins in PCOS, 113 women were randomized into three groups: metformin, statin, or both [75]. After 3 months, all agents showed a reduction in serum androgens, although simvastatin had the most pronounced impact [75]. Menstrual cyclicity improved with both simvastatin and metformin, with simvastatin having the most dramatic benefits in another study [76]. A further study with 84 PCOS patients randomized to metformin with statin and metformin with placebo found similar results- statins reduced testosterone levels and hirsutism significantly compared to placebo [77]. Statins improved lipid parameters and chronic inflammatory indices in PCOS patients in a recent meta-analysis, but not hyperandrogenemia or hyperandrogenism [78]. Given the mixed results, large scale RCTs are needed to explore the effects of statins in PCOS patients.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Combined oral contraceptives (COC):</h3>\r\n<p>Along with the lifestyle modifications, COC are the first line treatment for menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and acne in PCOS women not desiring fertility. COCs contain an estrogen typically ethinyl estradiol [EE]and a progestin. The risk of venous thromboembolism associated with COC rises with increasing dosage of EE [79] and varies with the progestin used. The androgenic properties of progestins may produce negative effects [80]. A systematic review [81] involving RCTs compared metformin to COC in improving clinical, hormonal, and metabolic features of PCOS and found that COC improved serum androgen levels compared to metformin; however, only metformin treatment resulted in improvements in fasting insulin and TGs levels. The most recent meta-analysis [82] involving 44 RCTs, confirmed that COCs were more effective than metformin in improving hirsutism.  However, the effects of COCs on cardiometabolic aspects remain concerning. EE increases serum TG and HDL-C levels without significantly affecting LDL-C levels [83], [84]. COCs have been linked to hypertension through the activation of the pro-inflammatory pathways of the renin&ndash;angiotensin&ndash;aldosterone system..  This can further augment the higher aldosterone levels typical in women with PCOS, who have a high tendency to the development of hypertension and obesity [61]. To minimize worsening of these disorders, PCOS women should be screened for hypertension and other cardiometabolic risk factors and thoroughly counseled about the risks of COCs prior to commencing such treatment. The two novel COCs containing 17-beta estradiol and 17-estradiol valerate may have a more favorable risk profile than that of EE [85], [86]. Weight gain, breast tenderness, mood swings, and intermenstrual spotting can occur with use of COCs.  Migraine headaches, smoking, prior venous thromboembolism, stroke, MI, hypertension, or breast cancer are all contraindications. Non-hormonal contraceptives options for PCOS women include condoms, diaphragms, copper containing intra uterine contraceptives devices, and sterilization procedures such as tubal ligations.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Isotretinoin:</h3>\r\n<p>Isotretinoin is used to treat moderate-to-severe acne and in situations when OCPs fail or are contraindicated. Isotretinoin treatment at 40 mg/day for 6 months in 40 PCOS women with severe acne significantly decreased insulin level, acne score, and ovarian volume [87]. Case reports suggested increased risk of CVD events including atrial tachycardia [88], premature ventricular contractions [89], MI [90], and stroke [91] with isotretinoin use, however large cross-over studies [92], [93] did not show a significant association between exposure to isotretinoin and increased risk of CVD events. Dry skin, dry mouth/lips, peeling of the skin, joint pain, back pain, dizziness, drowsiness, depression, are common side effects of Isotretinoin.  Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic, and highly effective contraceptives are a necessity while using it. The effects of isotretinoin on CV health in PCOS women need to be further explored in RCTs.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Other drugs to help with weight loss:</h3>\r\n<p>Orlistat is an inhibitor of pancreatic and gastric lipases and is commonly used to aid in weight loss. A meta-analysis reported that orlistat can produce significant reduction in BMI.  Orlistat and metformin yielded similar outcomes in reducing BMI, HOMA, testosterone and insulin levels in overweight/obese PCOS women [98]. It can also reduce CV risk factors by lowering TGs, and LDL-C, and can improve glycemic control by reducing fasting glucose levels. It is a relatively safe drug, with increased defecation, fecal urgency and fatty stools being the adverse effects. Naltrexone-bupropion combination acts by reducing appetite and increasing satiety. Diarrhea, dizziness, increased blood pressure, heart rate and insomnia are the common side effects. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder. Other weight loss medications include Phentermine-topiramate combination, phentermine, benzphetamine, diethylpropion and phendimetrazine [99].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Bariatric surgery:</h3>\r\n<p>Women with PCOS and severe obesity (BMI &gt;40) or moderate obesity (BMI &gt;35) with comorbidities are candidates for bariatric surgery. Metabolic derangements and fertility seem to improve following surgery. In a prospective single-arm study of 36 PCOS women, bariatric surgery led to resolution of PCOS with decreased in hyperandrogenism, IR, menstrual irregularity, and anovulation [100]. Long-term sequela is a concern.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion:</h3>\r\n<p>PCOS is far more than a reproductive disorder; it must be viewed as a serious metabolic disorder, with a multitude of abnormal findings and symptoms, accompanied by a significant risk for CV complications and events. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, hyperandrogenism, and IR with a high risk of T2DM are prevalent in the PCOS population, leading to high rates of CV events later in life as many of the consequences of the myriad metabolic abnormalities of PCOS women manifest later in life, typically in the fourth or fifth decade, it is critical to screen young PCOS patients for these metabolic and biochemical abnormalities and to treat them appropriately. The management of the underlying metabolic dysfunctions must be prioritized in women with PCOS, rather than simply trying to ameliorate symptoms. Treatment should be individualized to each patient\'s metabolic and CV risk profile, individual goals, personal and family history. While lifestyle measures remain the first step and must always be part of the therapeutic plan, pharmaceuticals including GLP-1 agonists, SLT-2 inhibitors, DPP4 inhibitors, potentially statins, and other possible medications, can offer powerful additional therapeutic options to address obesity, multiple metabolic dysfunctions, and to lower CV risk.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1.	<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17537782/\" target=\"_blank\">Barnard L, Ferriday D, Guenther N, Strauss B, Balen HA, et al.

K04 inhibited the growth of various microorganisms, including Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli. In this study, we also investigated a membrane fusion inhibitor JX0020, a modified SARS-CoV-2-HR2P peptide, which inhibited the infection of a spike containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC50 value of 0.049 mg/mL. More interesting, though K04 showed mild in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity with IC50 value of 0.43 mg/mL, it showed a strong synergism with JX0020 and significantly reduced the effective concentration of JX0020. Besides, K04 had no cytotoxicity activity to various mammalian cells. These results suggest that K04 has great advantages in the development of multi-functional antimicrobial agent.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Antimicrobial Agent; SARS-CoV-2; Peptide;</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), put significant strains on healthy system and economies around the world, there are widespread negative social, psychological and economic effects. Up to now, millions of people had died of SARS-CoV-2 infection and new variants are still emerging [1]. Delta and Omicron variants currently pose a &quot;double threat&quot; to the global outbreak. And as the outbreak continues, new strains may also emerge during a pandemic. Although the vaccines including whole-virus (live-attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and viral-vector) vaccines[2], subunit vaccines[3, 4], and nucleic acid vaccines (pDNA and mRNA)[5] had been designed to enable broad-spectrum protection against coronavirus pathogens, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that harbor mutations in the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain(RBD) may resist neutralization by antibodies, comprising vaccine efficacy[6, 7]. The continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations poses a major challenge to the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.</p>\r\n<p>It has been reported that the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by the S protein which binds to the membrane receptors, angiontensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and/or CD147[8, 9]. These membrane receptors on the host cells mediated the viral and cellular membrane fusion and contributed to SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells. S protein is divided into two subunits, S1 and S2. The RBD of S1 is responsible for recognizing ACE2 on the surface of human cells and completing the binding of virus to cells. Then S2 subunit is responsible for the fusion of virus envelope and human cell membrane to complete the invasion process. Two important conserved repeating amino acid sequences, heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2(HR2), are present in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2. The two domains combine to form a spiral structure called six-helix bundle core fusion structure (6-HB) which could bring the viral envelop closed to the cellular membranes[10]. Recent studies have shown that this 6-HB is the key to complete SARS-CoV-2 envelope and cell membrane fusion, which is also shown to be stronger and more efficient in entering cells than SARS virus[11]. Several peptides such as AP-9, EK1 et al were identified to potentially block the infection of SARS-CoV-2[12, 13]ï¼ŒAs a broad-spectrum anti-Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) therapeutic and prophylactic agent, it has broad development prospects in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other emerging HCoV diseases.</p>\r\n<p>KSL can directly act on microbial lipid membranes and has amphiphilic &alpha; helix and Net positive charge, so it has strong irreversible inhibitory activity against both bacteria and fungi. What&rsquo;s more, KSL has no hemolytic activity[14], so it has great potential to be developed as a new antibacterial agent. In this study, we generated a novel decapeptide, K04 (RRVVFHVKFK) derived from KSL which killed microorganisms through the action on the membrane as its primary target[15]. Our results demonstrated that K04 had higher activity against bacteria and fungi without cytotoxicity. More interesting, K04 had a strong synergism with JX0020 peptide, a membrane-fusion inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and significantly reduced the effective inhibition concentration of JX0020. The specific mechanism needs further study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Cells and peptide</h3>\r\n<p>Human embryonic kidney cell line 293T, Human hepatocyte cell line LO2 and human fetal lung fibroblast cell MRC-5 were purchased from Cell Bank/Stem Cell bank (Shanghai institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology). Human epidermal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was obtained from Biomedical Cell Resource Center (BMCR). LO2 and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium plus 10% FBS, MRC-5 and HaCaT cells were cultured in MEM medium plus 10% FBS and 1% NEAA in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37&deg;C. Peptides were synthesized with Fmoc-strategy solid phase methodology by Harbin Jixianglong Biotech Co. Ltd.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Growth inhibition assay</h3>\r\n<p>This test was performed with the strains Candida albicans CMCC(B) 98001, Staphylococcus aureus CMCC(B) 26003, Streptococcus mutans UA159, Escherichia coli CMCC(B) 44102. The reference drugs used were chlorhexidine and bisabolol. Aliquots of microbial suspension in indicated culture medium were mixed with peptides or reference drugs respectively and incubated at 37&deg;C for different time (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 h). Then, the viable cell count was done by diluting the suspension sample and plating aliquots of the dilutions onto an appropriate culture medium.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Inhibition of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection</h3>\r\n<p>Plasmid pLVX-puro, psPAX2, pcDNA3.1-Spike (SARS-CoV-2), pGL-Basic were purchased from Miaoling Plasmid Sharing Platform. To generate pLVX-luciferase-puro plasmid, Luciferase gene was amplified using pGL-Basic plasmid as template and cloned into pLVX-puro plasmid. The pseudoviruses were produced using methods as previously described. Briefly, 293T cells were inoculated into the 6-well cell plate, and the cell density was controlled at 70%-90% confluence before transfected with psPAX2 (3&mu;g), pLVX-luciferase-puro (4 &mu;g), pcDNA3.1-spike (SARS-CoV-2) plasmid DNA mix using Lipofectamine 2000. Six hours later, the medium was changed, and the transfected cells were cultured with fresh medium containing DMEM medium plus 10% FBS for 48 h. Then, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses containing culture supernatants were harvested, filtered and stored at -80&deg;C in aliquots. To detect the inhibitory activity of a peptide on infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, target cells (293T/ACE2) were seeded at a density of 1.5 &times; 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate one day prior to infection. Pseudovirus was mixed with an equal volume of a peptide which was series diluted with PBS at 37&deg;C for 1 h. EK1 peptide was used as positive control. The mixture was transferred to the target cells and incubated for 72 h. Then, cell supernatant was collected and luciferase activity was analyzed by the Luciferase assay system (Promega).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Cytotoxicity Assay</h3>\r\n<p>This test was performed with the cell lines LO2, HEK293T, MRC-5, HaCaT using CCK-8 assay as previously described with some modifications. Cells (5 &times; 103 or 1.5 &times; 104 per well) were seeded in 96-well cell plate and cultured at 37&deg;C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 12 h. Then, cell culture medium was changed with fresh medium containing a series of concentrations of peptides and further incubated for 24, 48 or 72 h respectively. Finally, 10 &mu;L of the CCK-8 reagent was added into each well, and OD at 450 nm was measured using a multimode microplate reader after incubation for 4 h at 37&deg;C.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results and Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>K04 demonstrated antifungal and antibacterial activity. Previous study had investigated the influence of different amino acid residues of decapeptide on the antifungal activity through screening the combinatorial peptide libraries composed of seven amino acids (Lys, Leu, Val, Pro, Ser, Phe, and Gln). The positively charged amino acid at the N terminus and the Lys at sixth position confer to the highest level of antifungal activity. In this study, we constructed three analogs of KSL (Table 1) by replacing the amino acid residue at the first, second and sixth position.</p>\r\n<p>KSL and its analogs K02, K03, K04 (Table 1) were generated by solid-phase synthesis in high purity (&gt; 95% by HPLC). Some physiochemical properties, such as their secondary structures, hydrophobicities (H), hydrophobic moments (&mu;H) and net charge (at neutral pH) were listed in Table 1. Similar to KSL, these analogs did not form perfect amphipathic &alpha;-helical structure in a wheel diagram, but the mutation of Lys to His at the sixth position increases the hydrophobicities (H) and decreases hydrophobic moments (&mu;H).</p>\r\n<p>To test the in vitro antifungal and anti-bacterial activity, KSL and its analogs were co-cultured with microbial cells for different times. Then, the live microbial cells were enumerated by plate count method (CFU/mL). As shown in Figure 1, among the three KSL analogs, K04 was the best anti-microbial agent and showed higher anti-microbial activity when compared to its native peptide KSL.</p>\r\n<p>To evaluate possible toxic effect of K04 peptide with healthy eukaryotic cells, different concentrations of K04 peptide were prepared and added into the cell culture media of human embryonic kidney cell 293T, hepatocyte cell line LO2, epidermal keratinocyte line HaCaT and fetal lung fibroblast cell MRC-5 for three days, respectively. As shown in Figure 2, the CCK-8 assays demonstrated that K04 caused almost no influence on the viability of cell lines tested at the concentration below 125 &mu;g/mL. Above results indicated that the membrane-active peptide K04 improved the anti-microbial activity by introducing three amino acid mutation.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\"><i>K04 synergized with membrane-fusion inhibitor JX00020 against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.</i></h3>\r\n<p>Each appearance of such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron mutant sets off a new epidemic of infections. And new variants have been found that make the vaccine less effective. In order to prevent reinfection of the virus, in addition to vaccines, new drugs that can block the fusion of the virus with cells need to be developed.</p>\r\n<p>Since SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated membrane fusion played important role on the virus infection, spike protein became an important target for the development of preventative and therapeutic drugs. As an optimized form of OC43-HR2P, EK1 peptide was reported to be a promising pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of human coronavirus spike[11].</p>\r\n<p>In this study, we constructed JX0020 peptide derived from HR2 region on the basis of the 6-helix bundle structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and introduced ten mutations (N6E, A7K, V10K, N11K, D17K, R18K, V22E, N25K, S29E, L36E), at the i to i + 3 or i to i + 4 positions to form intramolecular E-K or K-E salt bridges. Then, we used the pseudovirus assay, a good model to study the process of virus entry into the target cell, to assess the inhibitory activity of JX0020 against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with EK1 as positive control and K04 as negative control. As showed in Figure 3, EK1 demonstrated antiviral activity against pesudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC50 value of 0.143 mg/mL, while JX0020 exhibited improved fusion inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 0.049 mg/mL.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, K04 also showed mild antiviral activity with IC50 value of 0.43 mg/mL (Fig. 3C). Then, the synergic effect between K04 and JX0020 on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated. As showed in Figure 4, JX0020 improved the inhibitory activity with the increase of concentration from 15 &mu;g/mL to 150 &mu;g/mL in the absence of K04. In addition, when combined with a relatively low amount of K04 peptide (10 &mu;g/mL), JX0020 significantly decreased the effective inhibitory concentration from 150 &mu;g/mL to 15 &mu;g/mL by exhibiting the comparative inhibition activity. These results indicated that K04 had a strong synergism with JX0020 against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. A number of studies have shown that KSL and its analogs have significant antibacterial activities against a variety of bacteria and fungi. However, there have been no reports on KSL or its analogs antiviral or co-antiviral activities so far, and the specific mechanism needs further study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>In summary, our results indicated that K04, as a novel membrane-active peptide, demonstrated antifungal, antibacterial activity and synergic effect with membrane-fusion inhibitor without cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells. Antimicrobial peptides were paid more attention as the potential substitutions for common antibiotics. Our results suggested that K04 might be a promising drug candidate in the development of multi-functional antimicrobial agent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(7).png\" width=\"675\" height=\"780\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1:</b> Structures, predict models and physicochemical characteristics of synthetic peptides.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">a.

This is especially true in Israel, where there is a variety of different cultures reflected in different beliefs, philosophies, religions, origins, languages, and values. Study Objectives: This study attempts to examine the degree of organizational cultural competence from the perspective of the parents of hospitalized children, assess their degree of literacy, evaluate the patient experience of the parents, and establish an intervention protocol for healthcare teams serving multicultural and multilingual patients. <b>Methods:</b> A comparative prospective study that included 163 patients&rsquo; parents, 112 Palestinian and 51 Israeli, who were hospitalized in internal care and surgery departments. Research tools included the Patient Experience Questionnaire and the Health Literacy Questionnaire, completed by the parents of hospitalized children. <b>Results:</b> Palestinians parents were less confident than Israelis about health literacy, including completing medical forms, carrying out prescribed instructions, and obtaining help with reading and understanding medical information. Another result is that Israelis were less satisfied with the medical treatment. Discussion: The results indicated the need of understanding the gaps created due to language barriers and identity differences between Palestenians and Israels and steps to improve it. Another step were launched to improve the completely patient satisfaction.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Cultural competence; Patient experience; Health literacy; Medical care</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Background</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Israeli Reality and Cultural Diversity</h3>\r\n<p>Israeli society is increasingly characterized by changing demographics, mainly because of the continuous waves of immigration to Israel from many countries with diverse socio-cultural backgrounds (OECD, 2020). In addition, it is a binational country with two major population groups, Jews who comprise 74.8%, and Arabs comprising 20.8% of the population [1]. Because of this cross-community diversity, the Israeli populace is comprised of a mosaic of different cultures, languages, beliefs, practices, behaviours, and different degrees of religiosity [2]. Likewise, this diversity is manifested in the cultural and linguistic diversity of healthcare providers and of patients seeking health care [3].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Cultural Competence of Medical Services</h3>\r\n<p>Hospitals and community-based   health   facilities are often the focus of multicultural integration between people from different backgrounds, whether members of the nursing, paramedical, or medical staff, or the patients themselves [4]. This is especially true in Israel, where there is a variety of different cultures reflected in different beliefs, philosophies, religions, origins, languages, and values [5,6]. Indeed, the residents of Israel belong to different ethnic groups and cultures with diverse origins: Jews who immigrated to the country from both Western and Eastern countries, side by side with minorities: Muslim Arabs, Christian Arabs, and Druze [1].</p>\r\n<p>Cultural competence is one of the main strategies currently recognized by western health organizations for addressing issues related to multicultural population care [7-9]. Multi-cultural studies indicate cultural barriers and difficulties in communication both for patients and for medical staff [10]. Patients with cultural competence barriers are less likely to report symptoms [11]. There may be poor communicationdue to language andcommunication barriers, a lack of support networks, unfamiliar values, customs, and beliefs, different cultural backgrounds, and unfamiliarity and lack of understanding of patients&rsquo; cultural background (Spector, 2013) [12] Thus, sometimes the likelihood of understanding the nature of the treatment and the ability to receive an explanation of follow-up recommendations is reduced [13]. An incorrect diagnosis may be given due to communication difficulties, which increases the chance of medical errors and may delay treatment, and there is a chance that the patient will not follow instructions [14]. In addition, referrals of diverse populations for treatment or hospitalization may be avoided, with a consequent delay in providing care [15]. Among patients with different cultures, it has been shown that there is less use of primary care and emergency room [16]. On the other hand, there are repeated visits to the hospital due to misunderstandings, and there is a higher likelihood of violent behavior and less satisfaction with the treatment provided by health care providers [17].</p>\r\n<p>The Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) has defined activities to minimize health inequalities in Israel as a strategic goal and is working to reduce disparities in health care and health services. In the past decade, reports have been published describing a variety of cultural competence training and implementation programs for medical staff [17]. These programs focus on minority populations and address language difficulties, racial attitudes, and improving the cultural competence of the medical staff [18].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Health Literacy</h3>\r\n<p>Health literacy is one of the components associated with the cultural competence of organizations and with cultural and linguistic accessibility. The term health literacy has been used for over 30 years to describe the junction between the field of literacy and the field of health. Over the years, this concept has taken on different definitions. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the definition according to which: &ldquo;Health literacy includes the cognitive and social skills, which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to access, understand and use information, in ways that promote and maintain good health.&rdquo; Functional health literacy is expressed in the ability to apply literacy skills to health-related materials such as prescriptions, medication labels, and home care instructions [19].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Palestinian Medical Tourism in the Safra Children&rsquo;s Hospital</h3>\r\n<p>The Safra children&rsquo;s hospital is part of a large tertiary hospital Sheba Medical Center known for the broad range of conditions it treats and for its state-of-the-art facilities, including various departments and a heterogeneous patient population, Palestinians Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jews Patients. The medical staff is also heterogeneous and includes Jews, Arabs, Russians, and Ethiopians.</p>\r\n<p>In the last decade, an increase is evident in the number of Palestinian patients at Israeli hospitals. Statistical data prepared by the Office for Medical Tourism shows that about 100 Palestinian patients arrive at the medical center every day for hospitalization or continued care, including approximately 45 children at the children&rsquo;s hospital. This group includes Palestinian haematology patients who are residents of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and who come to Israel to receive medical care at the Sheba Medical Center. According to data received from the hospital&rsquo;s coordination unit for Palestinian patients, most of the Palestinian population treated is Muslim and maintains a strictly traditional life style. Based on our clinical experience, children who come are normally accompanied by an adult relative. The most common illnesses among these children are oncological diseases, closely followed by solid tumors in the brain and then by lymphoma diseases. The fourth most common are solid neuroblastoma tumors [1].</p>\r\n<p>The professional literature describes Palestinian citizens living in Gaza and the West Bank as belonging to a collectivist Arab society, whose values, norms, conservatism, and traditionalism are manifested in their family structure [2]. Studies show that the Palestinian healthcare system suffers from a lack of financial resources as well as a shortage of medicine, medical equipment, and healthcare infrastructure. Consequently, some medical treatments such as chemotherapy and scans are not available to the population. As a result, most people must travel to distant locations or to neighbouring countries such as Israel and Jordan in order to receive these essential treatments [2].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Objectives</h3>\r\n<p>This study attempts to examine the degree of organizational cultural competence from the perspective of the parents of hospitalized children, assess their degree of health literacy, evaluate the patient&rsquo;s experience of the parents patient&rsquo;s and establish an intervention protocol for healthcare teams treating multicultural and multilingual patients.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Hypothesis</h3>\r\n<p>Our first hypothesis was that differences in medical literacy would be found by nationality due to language difficulties, such that Israeli patients would have a higher health literacy score than Palestinian patients.</p>\r\n<p>Our second hypothesis was that differences in satisfaction would be found by nationality due to language difficulties, such that Israeli patients would have a higher satisfaction score than Palestinian patients.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Methods</h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Design</h3>\r\n<p>A comparative prospective study at a children&rsquo;s hospital. Subsequently, a quantitative questionnaire was used to collect data.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Setting and Sample</h3>\r\n<p>Two questionnaires were completed by 163 parents of children hospitalized in internal care and surgery departments at the Safra children&rsquo;s hospital. These were the Patient Experience Questionnaire (Zohar, Greenbaum &amp; Bachrach, 2015) [20] and the Health Literacy Questionnaire [21].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Ethical Data</h3>\r\n<p>The study was approved by the Helsinki Committee of the Sheba Medical Center (permit no. 4047/17). The participants were informed of the study&rsquo;s purpose and risks and of their rights. Participants, who were the parents of hospitalized children, were provided with the researcher&rsquo;s contact information, informed of the right to withdraw from the study at any time, and assured that their anonymity would be protected, whereupon they were asked to indicate their informed written consent to participate.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Instruments</h3>\r\n<p>The Patient Experience Questionnaire - This questionnaire was composed by the Department of Quality and Service Management, the Ministry of Health Service Division (Zohar, Greenbaum &amp; Bachrach, 2015) [20] for the Patient Experience Examination National Survey, to examine patient experience in general hospital departments in different areas (attitude, information delivery, treatment continuity and patient empowerment, perceived efficiency, and environmental conditions). Using the MOH questionnaire, comprised of 40 questions including 10 background questions, 8 quality indicators were created, each comprising a number of questions related to specific areas examined in the questionnaire. Each quality indicator was calculated as the mean of the most satisfied patients in each of the relevant questions. The internal reliability (Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha) for each indicator was found to be very high (from 0.7-0.9), showing that the distribution of the questions into indicators was optimal.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">The Health Literacy Questionnaire</h3>\r\n<p>(Baron-Epel, 2007) [21] - The questionnaire was The Hebrew Health Literacy Test (HHLT) was partly translated from the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and partly re-written in Hebrew to accommodate for the Israeli healthcare system, language, and culture, and then used to assess respondents&rsquo; health literacy levels. Internal consistency (Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha) of the 12 items representing the health literacy scale was 0.98. The questionnaire was shortened by Baron-Epel and colleagues (2007) [21]. Baseline measures included HL (Brief Health Literacy Screen); ability to obtain information on medical or clinical issues; ability to understand medical information and to reach conclusions from it; ability to estimate and interpret the value of the information obtained; ability to make thoughtful decisions on medical issues. The questionnaire included three areas that patients identified in qualitative studies as most important for their experience of the hospital-community link. The questionnaire defined the importance of post-hospital personal care, medication management, and treatment plan preferences. The shortened questionnaire contains 7 questions related to understanding written and oral explanations, confidence in performing treatment instructions, degree of assistance needed in reading and understanding the written and oral medical information.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Data Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 25; 2015) as an appropriate quantitative tool for health care research Descriptive statistics were used to present data in the form of frequencies and percentages for qualitative variables, as well as means and standard deviations.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p>The study included 163 patients, 112 Palestinians and 51 Israelis. Table 1 presents the distribution of the patients in the study by religiosity and education. It is apparent that in the Palestinian group there were more respondents who define themselves as religious than in the Israeli group. Moreover, it is evident that the Israeli group has a higher education level than the Palestinian group.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table1(8).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"287\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1:</b> Description of the patient population by nationality.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The results of the literacy questionnaire are presented in Table 2 by nationality. It is evident that in general Palestinians find it harder to understand medical information, complete medical forms, and understand information provided by the doctor, compared to Israelis, and they are less confident than Israelis about completing medical forms, carrying out prescribed instructions, and obtaining help with reading medical material.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table2(5).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"395\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 2:</b> Health literacy by nationality.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Table 3 presents scores for the literacy measures of difficulty and confidence, mean literacy score, as well as general satisfaction scores of all the questionnaire&rsquo;s items.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table3(4).png\" width=\"791\" height=\"218\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 3:</b> Description of literacy dimension scores for difficulty and confidence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our first hypothesis that differences in health literacy would be found by nationality due to language difficulties was confirmed. Israeli patients received a higher mean literacy score (M=4.14, SD=0.67) than the Palestinian patients (M=2.26, SD=1.04), (t(142)=14.7, p &lt; .001). In general, Palestinians received a lower mean score than Israelis for difficulty items and for confidence items as well as regarding the mean score for literacy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our second hypothesis was that differences in satisfaction would be found by nationality due to language difficulties, such that Israeli patients would demonstrate higher satisfaction than Palestinian patients. The research results indicated the opposite, as Palestinian patients demonstrated significantly higher general satisfaction (M=2.26, SD=.51) than Israeli patients (M=1.72, SD=0.44) (t)=6.55, p &lt; .001). The model indicates that in the Palestinian group the results are similar to the general results in - both of which predict the overall average (reception) predicted 18.6% (only, because the number of subjects is less than the general number) and again, the more important prediction is the difficulty factor and less the security factor. In the group of Israelis, in contrast, the results are not statistically significant (and yet even for them the difficulty factor affects opinions more than the security factor.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Sum of the models AMOS</h3>\r\n<p>Analysis of Moment Structures</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Graphic Model - Sum of correlations</h3>\r\n<p>AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) [22] is an IBM SPSS Statistics module designed for the analysis of covariance structure models, including structural equation modeling (SEM). Amos features a user-friendly graphic interface that allows nonprogrammers to visually construct models with common online drawing tools. Rectangles represent observed variables, while circles symbolize latent variables. One-sided arrows show hypothesized cause/effect relationships, and two-sided arrows illustrate nondirectional covariances. Arbuckle (2014) [23] provides detailed instructions focusing on the graphic interface, as well as interactive examples. We drew a theoretical model of relationships (correlations and regressions) between variables according to literary background the approximate model.</p>\r\n<p>The graphic model shows that all the regression coefficients and the correlations in the model were statistically significant and the directions (+ or &ndash;) correspond to reality &ndash; the direction of the scales. Ease of literacy was negatively associated with the mean score (the inverted ladders) as well as with related health and wellness (low but pronounced) with the average questionnaire. Confidence in literacy was associated with education and religiosity (in religiosity a high score indicates secularism). There was a high correlation between religiosity and education (logical) and there was a correlation between ease of literacy and confidence in literacy. Group (1=Palestinians, 2=Israelis) was associated with 2 literacy indicators (sensible. Higher Israelis in literacy) and between group and education (Between general satisfaction and all the other variables &ndash; negative correlations (reverse scales) and among themselves &ndash; positive.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/iamge.png\" width=\"435\" height=\"192\" /></h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>As hypothesized, our research found differences in health literacy and patient experience between two diverse populations - parents of hospitalized children at the Safra children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Our first hypothesis was that we would find differences in health literacy by nationality. As expected, Israeli parents received higher literacy scores than Palestinian parents. A similar finding was found in past studies in the Palestinian population. Arab patients reported having difficulties in communication with the medical staff and with understanding written medical orders In Hebrew or English due to language barriers. Patients who have low health literacy are less able to deal with the medical staff and to communicate their complaints to the physicians [24].</p>\r\n<p>The differences that we found between Israeli and Palestinian parents can also be connected to the level of education. Another study conducted with the Palestinian population found that the variable that most explained the high health literacy score was the father&rsquo;s level of education and on the other hand, a low level of parental education was associated with a low level of health literacy [25].</p>\r\n<p>There is an extensive literature dealing with the relationship between satisfaction with medical care and health literacy, such that the higher the level of health literacy the higher the level of satisfaction. As mentioned above, we hypothesized that differences in satisfaction would be found by nationality due to language difficulties, such that Israeli parents would have a higher satisfaction score than the Palestinian parents. The results of our study indicated the opposite: Palestinian parents were more satisfied with the care provided than the Israeli population. This finding can be explained by differences in the levels of medical care between the hospitals in the Palestinian Authority and Sheba Hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Satisfaction among medical tourists is a topic that has been extensively researched due to the economic contribution of medical tourism to hospitals. Studies have found that branding is of great importance in choosing a hospital among medical tourists and for satisfaction with treatment (Cham, Lim, Aik &amp; Tay, 2016) [26], but the most significant variables are perceived quality of care and medical facilities [27].</p>\r\n<p>Sheba Hospital is the largest hospital in the Middle East and has been selected for 3 years as one of the top ten hospitals in the world, given that the least advanced alternative to medical treatment among Palestinians in neighboring Arab countries can explain the high satisfaction among Palestinians.</p>\r\n<p>These findings highlighted the importance of understanding and improving cultural and linguistic barriers to health literacy. As a managerial strategy, we assume that an essential part of this change is partly due to cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and communication skills. During recent years, there were various educational projects such as workshops, lectures, and interactive interactions as an ongoing process. This strategic process was launched as a central message of the medical management. Our study investigated two essential issues involving cultural competence - health literacy and patient experience - focusing on the association between them.</p>\r\n<p>Our findings highlight the importance of our mission as professionals treating a diverse population to achieve the target of cultural competence. Similar highlights were found in the study by Guillem and colleagues (2020) [28] that emphasized that patient-provider communication is crucial for the quality of patient care. Patients suffered from poor health literacy regarding their personal condition, as they were unable to describe the symptoms, the type of tests performed, or their results, and some had difficulty naming the specific disease or their comorbidities.</p>\r\n<p>One of the studies dealing with health literacy and patient experience presents the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS&reg;) [29]. One of the purposes of the CAHPS surveys was to report quality information for accountability and consumer decision- making, a tool for quality improvement [30]. In addition, patients&rsquo; perception of teamwork between professional staff, [31]. Hatara and &Ouml;zer (2018) [32] assessed the organizational health literacy (OHL) of a group of hospitals and investigated the relationship between OHL, patient satisfaction, and patient health literacy. A high level of OHL was associated with high patient satisfaction, trust, medical insurance, and perceived quality of care, and a central issue involved in high levels of patient dissatisfaction with hospital care was found to be lack of trust [33].</p>\r\n<p>Our clinical and empirical experience leads us to a new paradigm that was reflected eduring the last two years. The COVID-19 global pandemic has revealed special vulnerabilities among the global population. Beside the physiological risk, various social factors such as lack of security, loneliness, isolation, dependency, stigma, and restrictions of health care access were identified as crucial in the pandemic [34]. COVID-19 is disproportionally affecting the poor, minorities, and a broad range of vulnerable populations, due to its inequitable spread in areas of dense population and limited mitigation capacity resulting from the high prevalence of chronic conditions or poor access to high quality public health and medical care. Moreover, the collateral effects of the pandemic due to the global economic downturn, as well as social isolation and movement restriction measures, are unequally affecting those in the lowest power strata of societies [35]. In Israel, as in other countries, there are population groups with specific cultural characteristics, and policymakers must treat them with cultural sensitivity, taking into account cultural gaps when dealing with interventions during the pandemic [34]. With regard to these issues, we are aware of a process that occurred at a central children&rsquo;s hospital that includes a varied population and that is dealing at present with the COVID-19 pandemic [37-40]. We described a study that was initiated before the pandemic and according to the findings; there were changes in the cultural competence policy. The leadership strategy of the hospital&rsquo;s management level led an educational process through special workshops to the medical staff given by specialists on these topics, open conversations, and a task force that investing on the various themes that arose from daily life [41-44]. Open feedback by the parents described an improvement in health literacy and in the patients&rsquo; experience. We assume that this was motivated by our study that was presented to them on literacy and patient satisfaction as one of the measures of cultural competence [45,46].</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>According to our findings, we recommend an ongoing procedure of monitoring cultural competence strategy as an integral part of the clinical work. An ongoing educational process that includes focus groups, workshops of all the professionals, and a leadership group of senior team members.</p>\r\n<p>The contribution of this specific study is the recommendation to train professional staff to understand the patients&rsquo; cultural aspects, beginning from the stage of diagnosis, through treatment, and until discharge from the hospital, with the purpose of improving the service. We focus our efforts on daily clinical work at the various stages during the pandemic by emphasizing topics of cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, and cultural sensitivity towards our target of improving the quality of care.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li>1. <a href=\"https://www.cbs.gov.il/en/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> (2021) Central Bureau Of Statistics (CBS).</a></li>\r\n    <li>2.	<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335194/\" target=\"_blank\"> Nahal MS, Axelsson AB, Imam A, Wigert H (2018) Palestinian children&rsquo;s narratives about living with spina bifida: Stigma, vulnerability and social exclusion.

This study assessed the prevalence and risk factors that enhance the transmission of urinary schistosomiasis infection among school- aged children of four selected schools in Lafia Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, Nigeria between December 2015 and April 2016. Four primary schools were randomly selected using simple random sampling. Urine samples were collected from two hundred (200) school-aged children and examined for Schistosoma haematobium. Out of the 200 pupils examined, 99 and 101 pupils respectively were males and females. The samples were analyzed in the Zoology Laboratory of Federal University of Lafia using Urino-Combi-11 reagent test strip to determine presence of blood in urine (hematuria) and centrifugation technique to determine presence of S. haematobium eggs in urine. Questionnaires were also administered to the pupils in selected schools to access their knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to schistosomiasis. Of the 200 school-aged children screened, 20% (40) were infected with schistosomiasis having an overall geometric mean intensity of 1.05625 eggs/10ml of urine. The prevalence of S. haematobium infection across the schools was predominant among St. James Primary School pupils 24.0% (12) followed by those in L.G.E.A Primary School Mararraba-Akunza 20.0% (10) while it was least in Ta&rsquo;al Model School and Lafia East Local Government Schools with 18.0% (9) each . Also, there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in prevalence rate of S. haematobium as well as geometric mean intensity in relation to age groups. About 96% of the school-aged children were exposed to water bodies to either play, bath or wash clothes. Hence, it is important to intensify awareness on the danger posed by exposure to this debilitating disease whenever individuals come in contact with water bodies that might be contaminated with schistosome parasites. Also, there is an urgent need for schistosomiasis vector control in order to effectively curb continual transmission in Lafia metropolis of Nasarawa State.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Keywords:</h3>\r\n<p>Urinary schistosomiasis; Risk factors; School- aged children; Geometric mean intensity; Microhematuria; Snail-vector control</p>', '<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Human-schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a prevalent parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematode worms) of the genus Schistosoma (1). Schistosomiasis ranks second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease and its transmission spans through 78 countries. This neglected tropical disease (NTD) afflicts about 220 million people globally particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (2) while about 236.6 million people are considered to require preventive treatment as at the year, 2019 (1).</p>\r\n<p>Schistosomiasis is closely associated with water, as snails carry the parasite, humans acquire the infection following direct contact with water sources containing infectious cercariae. The disease has a classic sign of haematuria (blood in urine), often with underlying fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and in more advanced cases kidney damage (3).</p>\r\n<p>The two major forms of schistosomiasis are intestinal and urogenital which are caused by 5 main species of blood flukes. Species of intestinal schistosomiasis and its geographical distribution include S. mansoni (Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname) S. japonicum (China, Indonesia, the Philippines) S. mekongi (Cambodia and the Laos), S. guineensis and related S. intercalatum (Central Africa) while the urogenital schistosomiasis caused by S. haematobium is distributed throughout Africa &ndash; risk of infection in freshwater in southern and sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, where new infections has been reported in Corsica (1,4).</p>\r\n<p>Children&rsquo;s perpetual habit of playing in water, increase their vulnerability to Schistosoma infection and the ideal target group to investigate for the prevalence of schistosomiasis especially in areas without access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation and hygiene, poverty and general neglect, where rivers, lakes and irrigation schemes facilitate its continued transmission (5). Following the 2001 resolution from the World Health Assembly (WHA), more resources have been channeled to control the surge of schistosomiasis with no success (6). In West Africa, Nigeria has one of the highest burdens in terms of urogenital schistosomiasis with the disease endemic across all 36 States in the country (7). Reportedly, Nigeria tops the list among countries of the world endemic for the disease with 20 million people requiring prophylactic therapy. Worryingly, three species of Schistosoma still ravage Nigeria where several reports have shown a higher occurrence of S. haematobium in Southern Nigeria and S. mansoni in Northern Nigeria. The third species S. intercalatum is hardly reported or mistaken for S. haematobium (8,9).</p>\r\n<p>Male genital schistosomiasis (MGS) and female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) lacks comprehensive epidemiological data owing to deficiency of research but in contrast, global interest has shifted to female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) as it remains a threat to at least 56 million women in endemic areas (2,9,10).</p>\r\n<p>Though children are the most at-risk group, prioritizing treatment for all population groups and not just to school children, would ensure timely control over this endemic. Findings has categorized pregnant women and preschoolers as other high risk-groups (11), it is important to provide useful information on the epidemiological status and disease distribution among these population in the different parts of the country (12).</p>\r\n<p>However, adoption of an integrated approach in the control of schistosomiasis including a deeper understanding of the population and associated prevalent factors, promises a lasting solution. Interestingly, greater attention had shifted to children and young adolescents in high endemic areas, with close proximity to water bodies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis among school-aged children in Lafia, Nasarawa State, update and provide information on the current status of urinary schistosomiasis for effective control of urinary schistosomiasis in Lafia, Nasarawa State and Nigeria at large.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Materials and Methods Study Area</h3>\r\n<p>The study was conducted in Lafia Local Government Area (LGA) of Nasarawa State, Nigeria. The population of the area is 330,712 (13). The wet season lasts from about the beginning of May and ends in October while the dry season is experienced between November and April. Annual rainfall figures range from 1200 mm to about 2000mm. The average maximum and minimum daily temperatures are 35&deg;C and 21&deg;C in rainy season and 37&deg;C and 16&deg;C in dry season respectively and relative humidity of 30% (14,15).</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Study Period</h3>\r\n<p>The study was carried out between December 2015 and April 2016.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Ethical approval</h3>\r\n<p>Ethical approval to conduct the survey with reference number NS/UBEB/S/EDU-259/VOL.1 was approved   on 19 November 2015 and obtained from the Nasarawa State Universal Basic Education Board, Nasarawa State Ministry of Education. Also, verbal consent was sought from both the authorities of the four public schools as well as the parents or guardians of the pupils. Pupils whose parents did not sign the consent were, however, not recruited into the study.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Selection of Schools</h3>\r\n<p>This study was carried out in four public primary schools in Lafia metropolis of Nasarawa State namely, Ta&rsquo;al Model Primary School (Latitude 8.519037&deg;; Longitude 8.521850&deg;), Lafia East Pilot Science School (Latitude 8.492773&deg;; Longitude 8.529467&deg;), L.G.E.A. Primary School Mararraba- Akunza (Latitude 8.474422&deg;; Longitude 8.583168&deg;), and St. James Pilot Science School (Latitude 8.498988&deg;; Longitude 8.513107&deg;). Schools were selected from schools&rsquo; list using simple random sampling. This was achieved through the procedure described by Hesse (16). A sketch or map was obtained of the study area. The corner of the map was selected and two baselines were drawn at right angles to each other. The interval width was then determined and a point was selected from the interval width and the four schools that were surveyed were randomly selected.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Pre-testing of questionnaires</h3>\r\n<p>Prior to start of data collection, pre-testing of questionnaire was done at the four selected schools.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Questionnaire administration</h3>\r\n<p>Structured questionnaires   were   administered   to the pupils shortly after urine samples were collected. Demographic data obtained were name of school, sex and age of the pupils, sources of water for drinking and household activities, sanitation, parents&rsquo; occupation, types of toilets, history of bloody urine and terminal haematuria and outdoor activities of the pupil such as swimming and fishing in water bodies.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Parasitological data</h3>\r\n<p>Sampling of school children was done according to WHO guideline (17) for schistosomiasis intervention survey. A total of 50 children were sampled in each of the four schools selected for the survey; therefore, a total of 200 school-aged children were sampled during the study. Students between ages 5 and 16 were stratified according to their educational status and a quota was allocated to each grade according to the number of students in each of the grade. The students who participated in the study were randomly selected.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Collection of samples</h3>\r\n<p>Urine samples were collected from the school- aged children in the four schools selected for sampling. The children were given dark (sterile) plastic universal containers with a unique identification label to collect their urine samples between the hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Following the procedure of Mafiana et al. (18), each urine sample, after collection was examined microscopically using centrifugation technique to determine the presence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Statistical Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>Data obtained were analyzed using R Console software (Version 2.9.2). Proportions of prevalence rate of urinary schistosomiasis in pediatric school-aged children in relation to age groups, schools as well as sex respectively was achieved using Pearson&rsquo;s Chi-square test. Level of significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Geometric Mean Intensity</h3>\r\n<p>The geometric mean intensity (GMI or xÌ„ geom) by definition is the nth root of the product of then units in a data set. The geometric mean is well defined only for sets of positive real numbers. The GMI was calculated with the aid of an online calculator (19).</p>\r\n<p><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/formula1(2).png\" width=\"316\" height=\"83\" /></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Microhematuria Intensity</h3>\r\n<p>Microhematuria intensity (MI) is expressed as the number of samples present with blood divided by number of infected individuals in percentage (%).</p>\r\n<p><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/formula2(2).png\" width=\"675\" height=\"62\" /></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Results</h3>\r\n<p><strong><i>Prevalence and intensity of urinary schistosomiasis infection in school-aged children in relation to age groups</i></strong></p>\r\n<p>Out of the 200 school-aged children examined for urinary schistosomiasis in the four schools sampled in Lafia, Nasarawa State, 20% (40/200) of the pupils were infected with S. haematobium as shown in Table 1.

About 84% of the pupils have not seen snails in water bodies close to their houses, however, only 35.5% of the children swim in the water bodies around of which 62% of such pupils swim daily. The main source of water for house use was from the river 96.5%. Only 27% of the pupils feel pain before passing out urine. The toilet was the main excreting site according to 71.5% of the pupils. About 6% of them mentioned that they pass out urine with blood while 94.5% of pupils&rsquo; urine was without blood.</p>\r\n<p><b>Table 7:</b> Risk factors associated with urinary schistosomiasis exposure of studied sites in Lafia</p>\r\n<p><input type=\"image\" src=\"/userfiles/table7(1).png\" width=\"632\" height=\"478\" /></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Nasarawa State is known to be endemic to schistosomiasis (20) and the lack of basic infrastructure and adequate awareness on the risk of schistosomiasis infection in school-aged children are sources of concern to the different stakeholders (21). The 20% prevalence of S. haematobium in this research possibly suggests that schistosomiasis infection is still endemic in Lafia, Nasarawa State due to very high predisposing risk factors in the area infection. The prevalence in this study is high compared to the national average prevalence of about 13% and 16% by Reuben et al. (5), Dawaki et al. (22), Akinneye et al. (23) and Obadiah et al. (24).</p>\r\n<p>The age group 8 - 10 years old with prevalence rate of (23%) were mostly infected probably due to high exposure to water bodies contaminated with the schistosome parasites. This also supports the findings of Nworie et al. (25) who reported highest prevalence of 14.5% among children of 8 &ndash; 10 years in Afikpo-North LGA, Ebonyi state, Nigeria. On the other hand, Mushi et al. (26) reported a moderate prevalence of 16.9% among under-fives in Mtama District, Lindi region of Tanzania. In a separate investigation, highest prevalence of S. haematobium (3.7%) was recorded among children of 10 &ndash; 12 years old in South Sudan (27).</p>\r\n<p>The geometric mean intensity of S. haematobium of 1.05625 eggs/10ml of urine indicates a low contact to water bodies by children. There is a close association between hematuria and S. haematobium. This is similar with the finding by Ugochukwu et al. (28) who recorded 10.1 eggs/10ml of urine from a total of 2064 screened urine samples, and also, obtained close relationship between hematuria and S. haematobium.</p>\r\n<p>The lack of variation in prevalence of the infection across the four schools possibly suggests that the children visit the same water bodies. Also, there is little or no variation in the microclimatic conditions that favours snails breeding success. This is not in agreement with the report by Ishaleku et al. (20) who recorded variation in S. haematobium infection among four schools in Keffi town, Nasarawa State.</p>\r\n<p>All sexes can be infected based on the observed lack of variation across sex-wise comparison. Although, simple percentage showed that a higher number (24.5%) of male children were infected than females (14.7%) which may be attributed to the frequency of exposure and activities of the males to cercariae infected water bodies. This is in consonance with the findings of Obadiah et al. (24) who reported high prevalence in males (24.1%) than females (18.6%). Also, Okwori et al. (29) reported 60% prevalence in males than in females (35.9%). On the contrary, findings by Ekpo et al. (30) and Nkegbe (31) reported slightly higher prevalence in females than males.</p>\r\n<p>The 95.5% of the pupils being exposed to river water bodies due to lack of access to potable water sources highly predisposes them to urinary schistosomiasis infection. This concurs with the study carried in Doma LGA of Nasarawa State where 41.4% of the respondents had contact with contaminated water and 33% of them drink unsafe water (32).</p>\r\n<p>The 62% of pupils who swim daily in river water bodies around are highly vulnerable to being infected. This is not in tandem with the finding by Pam et al. (32) who reported that about half of the respondents 41.2% had contact with water bodies once a week and at most time in the morning hours for the purpose of washing/laundry.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, 90% of the pupils are not aware of the danger posed by the presence of certain species of freshwater snails especially the Bulinus group that are the major snail intermediate hosts of Schistosoma haematobium which is the parasite that causes urinary schistosomiasis.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subtitle target=\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>This study has shown a 20.0% prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection among primary school- aged children in the four selected schools sampled in Lafia metropolis. Findings from this study also shows that the risk of continuous schistosomiasis transmission is high among school-aged children in Lafia due to lack of access to good potable water sources and other basic amenities thereby continually increasing exposure risk to schistosomiasis infection. Hence, it is important that the government and all the stakeholders concerned should wake up to their responsibilities to improve the standard of living of all citizens by ensuring that everyone have access to the basic amenities of life most especially potable drinking water so as to save the future of Nigeria because these age groups are indeed the future of our tomorrow. It is also advised that the authorities concerned should include snail intermediate hosts control measures in order to seriously complement the existing chemotherapy (praziquantel drug) for effective control of schistosomiasis. Children should not be allowed to play around river water bodies so as to prevent infection transmission risk. The inhabitants of Lafia metropolis should have a good sense of hygiene at all times.</p>', '<ul class=\"ullist\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/factsheets/detail/schistosomiasis.\"> WHO (2022).

In the process more than 250 Orthopaedic surgeons have been trained in early, effective and cheap treatment of CTEV and more than 1000 CTEV children have been treated.</p>\r\n<p>As Director of a budding Institute my vision is of an Institute which offers excellent teaching and tender loving care to patients and creates students with a vision to reach out the most modern and cost effective in medicine to the last man in the queue with humility and love. I have a track record of working with my superiors as a useful member of their team and have got affection and admiration from them.</p>', 'Santosh14049.jpg', '01', 'Editor', '2019-10-29 01:16:00', 0),

(296, 2, 25, 'Pyrear Suhui, ZHAO', 'Brigham and Women\'s Hospital', 'USA', '<p>I graduated from South China Agriculture University in 2010 with a B.Sc. in Biological Science. During this time, I was able to work on a project on detection of aluminum residue in jellyfish product, which is part of the project &ldquo;Industry Standard Control of Aquatic Products&rdquo; at the Department of Biological Science within the university. Later that year I started the M.Med. program majored in Pathogenic Organisms at the Southern Medical University which I completed in 2013. During my master&rsquo;s, I was actively involved in four different projects related to detection and characterization of infectious pathogens, (i) &ldquo;A Real-time PCR detection method for Francisellatularensis with TaqMan probe&rdquo;, (ii) &ldquo;The function of EspF protein in E. coli&rdquo;, (iii) &ldquo;The molecular epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging adenovirus&rdquo;, and (iv) &ldquo;The investigation of attenuated bivalent vaccine for adenovirus&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>To expand my knowledge as a virologist of infectious disease, I joined the laboratory of Kwok- Yung Yuen at the University of Hong Kong to pursue a PhD degree. During my PhD study, I was focused on the novel and emerging infectious viruses, microbial discovery and bioinformatics of pathogens epidemiology and evolution. I worked on three projects relevant to zoological viruses and infectious diseases, (i) I independently completed a five-year cohort project of characterization of genetic evolution of circulating picornaviruses from 2008 to 2018. I summarized and characterized the prevalence and epidemiology of diverse emerging/potentially emerging circulating picornaviruses, identified the predominant species and the recombination events which are related to more severe diseases, measured the efficacy of commercial intravenous immunoglobulin on the novel/emerging/re-emerging virus strains, and deciphered the mechanism of virus genetic evolution by using bioinformatic tools; (ii) I detected and isolated the novel/emerging zoological viruses (such as parvovirus, paramyxovirus, picornavirus and coronavirus) from wild and domestic animal samples, such as bat, rodent, birds, feline, canine, swine, dolphin, and alpaca. To further analyze the novel/emerging virus, I sequenced and annotated the whole genome of selected virus strains and performed the evolutionary and phylogenetical analysis on them using bioinformatic tools; (iii) Based on the findings of the novel/emerging zoological viruses, I developed a rapid on-site detection kit for COVID-19 (onestep colorimetric reverse-transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (COVID- 19-LAMP).</p>\r\n<p>Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral research fellow in Athe M.N. Tsibris&rsquo;s laboratory at the Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. I have worked to investigate the mechanisms of HIV latency and reactivation combined with single cell sequencing tools, which is necessary to understand how HIV rebounds after ART treatment cessation, and surely, will provide a comprehensive data library for HIV drug and LRA screening. My work involves the measurement and characterization of genetic and proteomic changes in HIV infection model by using cutting edge single cell sequencing techniques (such as scRNA sequencing) and computational analysis platforms (such as R and Python).</p>\r\n<p><b>Research Interest</b></p>\r\n<p>My research interest is to develop a latency model for HIV and decipher the genetic and proteomic heterogeneity of HIV latency and reversal using the cutting-edge single cell sequencing techniques. A well-known strategy to cure AIDS is the &ldquo;kick and kill&rdquo; theory, which uses drugs to reactivate latent HIV and eradicate infected cells by the host immunity. Although the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been proven effective in significantly delaying disease development, prolonging the life span, and improving the outcomes of patients, the extremely rare and long-lived reservoirs of HIV (provirus) are undistinguishable and persisting in ART-suppressed patients and will rebound rapidly after treatment cessation. HIV-1 proviruses from reservoir cells are transcriptionally or translationally inactivated or occluded to be recognized and purged by the immune system, which mainly preclude of the cure of ART-suppressed individuals. Due to the extremely low frequency of persisting latently infected cells in patients, primary cells from HIV individuals are difficult to sample and limiting the research of HIV latency. Many in vitro and ex vivo models have been developed to investigate HIV infection and latency, a comprehensive model is required to overcome the limitations of currents models, for example, limited response to latency reversal agents (LRA) stimulation. The rapid progress of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques are widely used in cancer investigations. HIV models in cooperated with the single cell techniques provide a new path to quantify and identify the changes of the genetic, proteomic, and cellular levels in HIV models. Furthermore, the combinations of different single cell techniques in conjunction with integrative computational data analysis will provided a more comprehensive way to understand the HIV infection, latency, and reactivation, and eventually, to develop an efficient HIV therapy.</p>', '440818.jpg', '04', 'Editor', '2022-04-13 01:30:05', 1),

During my PhD, I joined as a visiting research fellow (IUSSTF) at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 2016 and developed &pi;-conjugated radical anion polymers. After PhD, I pursued a postdoctoral fellowship from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, where my research focus represent development of polymeric nanoparticles for targeted and controlled drug delivery.</p>\r\n<p>I joined as a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Xiankai Sun&rsquo;s team in the Department of Radiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX) (March 2018 &ndash; present). In this position, I improved my expertise in a modern area of molecular imaging research, focusing on radiolabeling of small molecules and drug conjugates for cancer imaging and therapy. I am an experienced radiochemist with extensive knowledge of organic synthesis. Skilled in preclinical and clinical research for the development of PET-drugs and theranostic drug conjugates focusing on 18F, 11C, 125I, 68Ga, 64Cu, and 67Cu radiochemistry.

Testimonies and Experiences from those who took it: https://prezi.com/i/byzl22mqwfaa/compilation-of-cv-experiences/\r\n\r\nBiggest consensus from this info is to not take the vax. Its very dangerous! Why take a vaccine when COVID survival rate is above 99%? The media focuses on cases rather than deaths....why is that? Also, there are more deaths overall relating to other fatalities/diseases (cancer, heart problems, etc) than there is COVID. This is not a \"vaccine\", this is an mRNA shot. It changes your DNA for the worse, not better.\r\n\r\nYou canâ€™t sue Pfizer or Moderna if you have severe Covid vaccine side effects.

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. -Romans 10:9,10 KJV\r\n\r\nWhosoever denieth The Son, the same hath not The Father; he that acknowledgeth The Son hath The Father also. -1 John 2:23 KJV\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is The Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God. -1 John 4:15 KJV\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on The Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son.\r\nAnd this is the record, that God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son.\r\nHe that hath The Son hath Life; and he that hath not The Son of God hath not Life.\r\n-1 John 5:10-12 KJV\r\n\r\nAnd from Jesus Christ, who is The Faithful Witness, and The First begotten of the dead, and The Prince of the kings of the earth. Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own Blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever Amen. -Revelation 1:5 and 6 KJV\r\n\r\nBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by The Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is The Stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the Head of the Corner. Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

(172, 'Jesenia Lytle', 'jesenia.lytle@gmail.com', NULL, 'To better understand the true vaccine agenda and the nano-technolgy that is being employed in this DNA altering mRNA vaccine, which is really not a vaccine to begin with, Google the following.... profusa hydrogel, microdot vaccines, luciferase tattoo\r\n\r\nHere are some very sobering warnings from the Lord about the consequences of taking the vaccine and altering your DNA.\r\n\r\n#1 â€˜The Mark Of The Beast Is Hereâ€™ \r\nReceived by July Whedbee July 29, 2020\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tattoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do.\r\n\r\nWhen you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance.\r\n\r\nMy people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered!\r\n\r\nThe technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul.\r\n\r\nThe evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness. \r\n\r\nThe time is now..\r\n\r\nYAHUSHUA  (JESUS)\r\n\r\n\r\n#2 You Must CHOOSE NOW to NOT Take the MARK or VACCINE\r\nCryptic1  Message given 8/9/2020\r\n\r\nThere will be a great shaking all across the land. It is coming. All will know who I AM is then. In those days many will cry out to Me. Have I not given out warning upon warning and still many of My own have not prepared? Seek Me now while I may be found. Seek Me wholeheartedly in My Word, in worship, in kneeling before Me in repentance â€“ I will be found. Time is short. Time is precious. Use it wisely for it is on the move â€“ passing -never to return. Many will cry out to Me in that day. Is it not better to call out to Me now while I am here?\r\n\r\nCHILDREN THE TIME IS COME TO CHOOSE â€“ TO TAKE THE VACCINE OR NOT â€“ TO TAKE OF THE MARK OR NOT. NOW IS THE TIME. NOW IS THE HOUR. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL IT IS AT YOUR DOOR â€“FOR IT WILL BE TOO LATE FOR MANY OF YOU. MANY WILL BUCKLE AND CAVE IN TO THE DEMANDS OF THE ENEMY. WHEN THERE IS NO FOOD, NO HOME, NO MONEY â€“ IT WILL BE HARDER TO STAND AND EASIER TO TAKE THE MARK AND THE VACCINE. YOU MUST STAND BEFORE ME NOW AND SUBMIT YOUR WILL TO MY WILL. ALLOW ME TO LEAD YOU AND GUIDE YOU CHILDREN. THERE WILL BE MUCH SUFFERING BUT IT WILL BE GREATER (SUFFERING) WITHOUT ME. CHOOSE NOW. CHOOSE LIFE WITH ME AND FORSAKE THIS WORLD AND ITSâ€™ TRAPPINGS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM I OFFER â€“ OR CHOOSE DEATH. ETERNAL DEATH I SAY â€“ FOR ONCE YOU TAKE OF THE MARK YOU ARE AS DEAD TO ME FOR YOUR SOUL WILL BE LOST TO ME ETERNALLY FOREVER.\r\n\r\nI have said to persevere until the end. I have said there would be tribulation. I have said that anyone who does not give up father or mother or their loved ones is not worthy of My Kingdom and to sit at My right hand. Only the Father knows the day and the hour so prepare, prepare for all that is coming.\r\n\r\nGround your hearts in Me â€“ the firm foundation of Truth. Many will be caught up even now in the lies and deception of the evil one. I am the Way, I am the Truth, I am the light of the world. Come follow Me children. Persevere to the end. I will be with you always. Guard your hearts. Forgive your enemies. Keep your garments white and pure. Be holy as I am Holy.\r\n\r\nI come upon the clouds of glory for My own.\r\n\r\nYour Savior Lord and King\r\n\r\nYeshua\r\n\r\n\r\n#3 Covid-19 Vaccinations MEAN DEATH! Esther Eagle\r\nMarch 3, 2020\r\n\r\nI was praying and fasting, regarding the Covid-19 vaccine during the time Iâ€™ve received this dream:\r\n\r\nIn my dream, God took me into the near future of America. I was overlooking America (like a birds eye view), and I looked to my right of America (the Eastside) and was overlooking New York State as well.. And I saw millions of people in America, had received the Covid-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\nAnd also throughout America, I could see 5G towers monitoring VERY closely the covid-19 vaccinated individuals (victims).\r\n\r\nWhen I saw this, I immediately asked God, â€œHow are they completely connected to these 5G towers and the towers to them?â€ Right after I asked God this, He took me to a hospital in New York. There, I saw a doctor giving a patient, the covid-19 vaccine. (The doctor and patient couldnâ€™t see me.)\r\nBut while the doctor was injecting into the patientâ€™s arm, the covid-19 vaccine shot.. I saw hundreds/thousands of little specs of microchips, [nanobots] INSIDE the covid-19 vaccine, flowing through the shot, and into that individual.\r\n\r\nAs the dream went on,\r\nOne thing got my attention immediately..was that the people whoâ€™d taken the Covid-19 vaccine, their whole body was glowing an odd color green. I asked God, â€œWhat does this mean?â€ And I saw the word, â€œradioactiveâ€.\r\n\r\nAND, upon seeing this..I also saw that they had extra super dark energy-that is, super demonic energy- attached to them!\r\n\r\nAlso, the word â€œLEGIONâ€â€¦was written all over them as well!\r\n\r\nThe Lord took my up higher in the dream (again birds eye view, but over looking America). And the millionâ€™s of people, whoâ€™d priorly were covid-19 vaccinated and being controlled by the 5G towers.. BEGAN to grow to be VERY violent and AGGRESSIVE, VERY beast like..\r\nIn fact, the news called it, â€œAn outbreakâ€ and that those same people (those with covid-19 vaccine in their blood) were deemed â€œINCURABLEâ€.\r\n\r\nThese (covid-19) vaccinated individuals, where EVERYWHERE (when the â€œoutbreakâ€ occurred)! There was NO LINE they werenâ€™t willing to cross, (be it in, violence, murder, mayhem, ravaging, etc). . They were COMPLETELY and UTTERLY out of hand!\r\n\r\nI was taken to a very disturbing scene:\r\n\r\nA major city, in the mid-eastern side of America.. were infested with â€œincurablesâ€..They were literally running all over-many on all fours-just like beasts! They were running out of a city, that they had priorly taken over, (I saw thousands laying dead all over the streets of that city.. the smell and sight was HORRIBLE!)\r\n\r\nI saw then, that the same (CV-19 vaccinated) crazed â€œincurablesâ€ were ALL at war, with the EVERBODY, including the U.S. military! Looking down at the outskirts in this same city, it was a scene of COMPLETE utter confusion, torment and chaos!\r\nThe US military soldiers were in the thousands, and armed with machine guns etc, were shooting (by the droves), all â€œinfectedâ€ on sight!\r\n\r\nThe â€œinfectedâ€ (so full of legion within themselves; in the hundreds of thousands), were throwing metal objects, rocks-whatever they could find-all against the U.S. Military..the â€œinfectedâ€ were even jumping off of vehicles (theyâ€™d jump as high as 8-10 in the air) and tall objects to gain ground against the U.S. Military..\r\n\r\nThe â€œinfectedâ€, didnâ€™t care to loose their own lives either!\r\n(As before mentioned..â€there was no line they werenâ€™t willing to cross..â€)\r\n\r\nI saw these â€œincurableâ€ (CV-19 vaccinated) people were in the millions, everywhere in America, they were burning up, homes, cities, towns, neighborhoods..\r\n\r\nDuring this â€œOUTBREAKâ€..that resulted throughout the U.S. Martial Law was issued, as the military soldiers each had orders to: â€œShoot ALL incurables/infected ON SIGHT!â€\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had to be in gathered in large groups at a time and use special automatic machine guns..because it literally took LOTS of bullets just to kill one â€œincurableâ€ on sight. .\r\n\r\nIt was far worse on the East side of America too, especially because of the â€œmost infectedâ€ cities there (as the media put it)..\r\n\r\nRight then, seeing all this, I heard the Lord repeat 3xâ€™s: â€œCovid-19 Vaccinations MEAN DEATH!â€\r\n\r\n*Note: I told myself, for the Lord to use the word, â€œDeathâ€..I knew strongly in my spirit, He meant, â€˜Eternal deathâ€™.\r\n\r\n#4 What the Mark is like\r\nMarch 29, 2020\r\n\r\nDaughter of God\r\nI got to experience in this dream what it would be like to receive the mark of the beast.\r\n\r\nDream:\r\n\r\nThere was 2 of me and we were standing in a tent where a nurse was giving vaccinations. I had a choice to take the vaccine or not. I said â€œI donâ€™t want that, it could be the mark of the beast.â€ The nurse reassured me saying â€œno itâ€™s not, itâ€™s just a vaccine, just a precursor to the mark, itâ€™s nothingâ€. The other me said â€œIâ€™ll go first, donâ€™t be a chicken, itâ€™s nothingâ€. Then I started seeing through her eyes. For the rest of the dream I was in that other version of me that chose to take the mark. I believe God was showing me this so I could see what it is like and warn others. Itâ€™s going to get real dark and disturbing from here so I wont even tell all the details of it.\r\n\r\nOk so the nurse pulled out a tattooing device and tattooed me in the center of my forehead. I barely felt it and looked in the mirror to see if it was done and I saw a circular pattern of quantum dots. They glowed white. About 2 cm diameter. Then the nurse got me to draw a symbol. I knew the symbol was to seal the deal. It seemed to be some kind of witchcraft symbol. It had a triangular shape at the top with a spiral under it. I wonâ€™t draw it again to show you, for obvious reasons. Remember it wasnâ€™t me doing it, I was like an observer but seeing through her eyes with no control of what was happening.\r\n\r\nThen I felt demons attach to me, one on each side and I felt changed. I felt Holy Spirit and love leave me and my heart felt empty and dead. It scared me, the nothingness inside, like a void that canâ€™t be filled. It felt so cold. But I felt powerful and had superpowers but they were like magic, like witchcraft powers. I went out to test them out. I could wave my hand over things to repair them and I could jump through portals to other places. I was hanging out with the rich and famous. They all had the mark too. I felt an immense pride and superiority over â€œregularâ€ humans. I felt no empathy whatsoever. This must be what a psychopath feels. I was killing people like it was nothing. Iâ€™ll stop there. You get the point: The mark made me evil in the dream. It made me sick, (the real me), I knew at was wrong but couldnâ€™t stop it. I actually repented when I woke up because the dream disturbed me so much. It was nothing like me in real life. In real life I have a big heart and love and care for others and Iâ€™m not proud at all. Iâ€™m just a humble servant for God. I never want to experience anything like that again.\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t take the vaccine, it is the mark and will turn you into a monster. Youâ€™re better off dying than taking this mark.\r\n\r\nI asked God for a confirmation of this dream and He gave me this scripture :\r\n\r\nFor we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. â€“ Ephesians 6:12,13\r\n\r\nGod bless\r\n\r\n#5 SO BE IT!\r\nSeptember 29, 2020\r\nOnly A Grain Of Sand\r\n\r\nI AM gave you the Ten Commandments as The Law. You repudiated them entirely, slowly, over time making them a mockery and or an enforced private predilection, or illegal and a hate crime.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM send My Only Begotten Son Jesus The Christ to offer His Life & Blood as an efficacious Sacrifice for your sins, and the sins of your forefathers (individual & collective). You rejected Him and made your self gods.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM gave you the Bible, My Holy Word in the Old & New Testaments, the inspired Word of the Holy Spirit. You edited it, miss-translated it, re-wrote it, cut and pasted it, re-interpreted it, cut out books from it, made it gender neutral, hated it, dismissed it, forgot it, treated it like fiction or a novel, refused to honor it, burned it, trampled on it, used it in satanic rites, accepted it in part, spit on it.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM sent the prophets, many watchmen and watchwomen to you. But you scorned them, rejected, murdered, ignored, laughed at, dismissed, silenced, or quibbled at their every word, arguing about semantics, the dot-and-tittle, dissected the grammar and mocked My Words to your perdition.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM heard your grumbling, rejection, detestation of My Divine Will, making your human will an idol, worshiped by all the nations of the world.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou destroyed My Little Ones (Abortion). Grinding them up, sucking them out of the womb live, pulverizing them into a bloody mush, murdering them after they came out of the womb. Selling their body parts, daubing them as cosmetics on your faces, using their glands as drugs for the elites, discarding their bodies in dumpsters, using them in food as sweeteners and genetic research.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou changed girls into boys, and boys into girls and altered the definition of masculinity and femininity, marriage, family, and made your bodies which are Temples Of The Holy Spirit into debased animalistic idols. You ran after and lusted for strange flesh and My Creation, the animal kingdom, as your sexual partners without shame or remorse.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou made idols of the rich and famous and media stars making them gods of the cult of personality, worshiping their every word, gesture and action fornicating with satan, as you danced after the damned.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou made a religion out of your country, your national pride, your wealth, power your hegemony world-wide as The Hammer of All. With military might controlled all the peoples of the earth with wars, assassinations, coupes, extortion, domination, threats, sanctions, invasions, secret operations, drugs, sale of weapons of mass destruction, financial manipulations of currency, stocks & bonds, precious metals, international treaties, deals under the table, pornography, child trafficking, slave labor, abductions, and violent (god-of-forces) medias.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou have now turned your attention to making child sex and cannibalism legal.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou exported a Corporate/Industrial/Commercial Complex to destroy and overpower all the indigenous cultures, peoples of the earth to make a homogeneous one world way of life of commercialism, materialism, with a secular humanistic world view on the road to openly worshiping the snake king. A world view that has obliterated the unique way of life of cultures that have existed and formerly flourished for thousands of years.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou have duplicated and followed the paths of all of the former world civilizations of the past. Initial germination, vigorous youth and strength, morality, peace and justice, beginnings of great abundance and wealth, aggression and domination of neighbors, the first signs of decadence and perversion, internal strife, weakness, exhaustion, collapse and now final annihilation.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou worshiped your kings. Raising them to godhead. Putting your total faith in an man, instead of God, believing their lies and tricks, and playing a political two party system that has transfixed your your people for countless generations and divided you against your neighbor, in a useless game of Divide & Conquer, leading to chaos, riot, carnage, destruction and now to murder.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou chose a Culture of Death over Life. You chose Hell over Heaven.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou Chose Today Over Tomorrow. Exchanging the gift of eternal life offered to you by a Loving Creator God The Father for and eternity with the snake king, in a lake of fire with no love, peace, light, joy or pause.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou bartered your inheritance for a mess of potage, for a dish of lentils you threw away a glorious legacy of a never ending future of unlimited horizons.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou chose Night (secret sins, thefts, hidden addictions, whispered lies, gossip, calumny, unforgiveness rehearsed for never-ending years, occult perversions) over Day (godly transparency, honesty, strait forwardness, upright actions, truth).\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou scorned, laughed at modesty, virginity, decency, destroying the youth of multiple generation with sex, drugs, rock-n-roll.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou legalized gambling, prostitution, promoting addictions, obsessions, compromising individuals, families, marriages, building underworld empires and sin-cities of satan, like Los Vegas & Atlantic City, which will both be soon destroyed.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou elevated Sport to a false religion, destroying youth in the bloom of their vigor with obsessive ambition for extravagant wealth and lust for fame, who worship at an evil altar instead of making their dedication, talent, hard work towards a career, a balanced part of their lives.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou let the MSM tell you what to think, what to buy, what to say, what to love, what to hate, what to obey, what to worship.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou accept the lies and dictates of corrupt and satanically oriented politicians who are bent on your own destruction, and sacrifice their own flesh (sons & daughters) to satan.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou follow after an occult based popular culture taking their diabolically dedicated products into your homes and filling your eyes, ears, mouths with its rancid filth, death, and destruction.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou choose satan, the snake king, the devil, the man of perdition, the anti-Christ, over God The Father, God The Son, God The Holy Spirit.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou choose yourself over your families, your loves ones, your neighbors, your God.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou choose to put off today, what you know should be done to prepare for the Great Tribulation, that is now at your door-step.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou decided this message is the ravings of a lunatic, a false or deluded person who needs to be more tolerant, mind their own business, get-a-job, just plain shut-up, go away, be silent, forget it, change the channel, get lost, go to jail, be reported, locked up, forcibly stopped!\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nThe Sun Went Down, The Day & Night Came & A Darkness Covered The Earth & All The Peoples Of The World Made Their Final Decision YES Or NO To Their God!\r\nSO BE IT!', '2021-03-03', 1),

Those who have been inoculated with the experimental mRNA vaccines are causing those around them, predominately females, to suffer from some of adverse side effects that those who have been vaccinated are. Women who have been through menopause are once again having monthly periods accompanied by very severe blood clotting and head aches. Others are having still births and experiencing strange bruising on their legs. Those effected are warning others to stay away from the vaccinated. It remains to be seen if other dangerous side effects will also be transferred as well. A whistle blower from a Vaccination Task Force says the doctors on the panel are very concerned about prion diseases showing up in the vaccinated months after taking the jab.

Basically, foods closer to nature. The other key is minimizing processed foods, including sugars and flours.3 \r\n \r\nWithout realizing it, I followed Katzâ€™s advice: I ate mostly fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, and dairy. I occasionally had whole grains like quinoa or farro, even rice or corn chips. And, of course, an occasional treat. But I had sworn off sugars and flours, for the most part. \r\nBehavior change and weight loss \r\n \r\nItâ€™s hard to keep track of how much we eat. But a lot of research shows that when we keep track of intake, we eat less. This is called self-monitoring, and why writing down what I ate and weighed helped me.4,5,6 There are so many ways to do this nowadays: from the old-school paper-and-pencil method, to apps like MyFitnessPal, or the Weight Watchers points system.7 \r\n \r\nAnother key approach: forgive your failures. Studies show that people who â€œmess upâ€ their diet plan and then â€œgive upâ€ end up gaining, while people who forgive themselves and move on continue to lose. Itâ€™s called self-acceptance.8,9 Look, weâ€™re human. Birthdays, office parties, weddings, random movie nights: they happen, and we celebrate by having the amazing chocolate cake, or Betsyâ€™s famous buffalo chicken dip, waaaay too much champagne, or buttered popcorn. Expect this, enjoy, and then move on. \r\nExercise and weight loss \r\n \r\nMost major weight loss is followed by weight gain, as people revert to their old habits. But, some folks manage to keep it off. How do they do it? Researchers have found that maintaining a healthy diet, ongoing self-monitoring, plenty of self-acceptance, as well as a high level of physical activity are all associated with keeping the pounds off.10 \r\n \r\nWhen I feel like Iâ€™m slipping, I start logging again. Nowadays, I use an online fitness app on my phone to more easily keep track of my daily food intake. Red wine and dark chocolate are always in stock in our house, and thatâ€™s OK. Exercise is important, too, but in my book, any and all physical activity counts. Two or three workouts a week help me maintain muscle tone and cardiovascular fitness. If I canâ€™t get to the gym, I run. If I canâ€™t run, I do something at home, like five minutes of in-place kickboxing moves, or dancing around the living room like a crazy person with my kids. I take the stairs wherever I am as often as possible. I use a carry basket at the grocery store, and switch from arm to arm while I shop: biceps curls! Hey, it all counts. \r\nStaying at a healthy weight for life \r\n \r\nThe old adage is â€œeat less, exercise more,â€ and this is still true, to some extent. But human beings are psychologically and sociologically complex creatures, and that adage is a lot harder to follow than it sounds. For average adults who do not have contributing medical or psychological issues, a nutritious plant-based diet low in processed foods and carbohydrates, consistent self-monitoring of intake and progress, forgiving oneself when expected lapses occur, all combined with regular physical activity, can result in weight loss for life.', '2021-09-21', 1),

Conducting marketing campaigns. \r\n8. Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. \r\n9. Notification speed. \r\n10. Price. \r\n11. Entering the markets of other countries. \r\n \r\nCompetitive advantages: \r\n \r\n1.When sending mailing by feedback forms, all e-mails arrive in the inbox folder. When sending mass e-mails, this can reach up to five percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million letters per day to inboxes. When sending bulk e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, the remaining ones often either are not delivered or arrive in the junk. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a message does not get blocked by mails because it is sent from different websites. When sending mass e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be blocked. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by contact forms the very little amount of macros is used to form headings and text of the letter. When sending bulk e-mails, it is necessary to use Â«macrosÂ» (synonyms) for each word and create ten thousand different headings. \r\n \r\n5. A lot of organisations deliberatelly hide their electronic address and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending e-newsletters, your business offer is delivered to every employee of the organisation, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the message is received at the electronic address specifically set up for  cooperation  offers. \r\n \r\n7.50% of business mailboxes are placed on free mail systems, they are not very \"searchable\" by email, but when sending mailing by feedback forms through these e-mail servers, all e-mails are hundred % delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty percent of companies are published in the directories within several years, and the rest are already located in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your commercial offers. \r\nThus that e-mails of organisations from directories are filled with spam, and therefore they will not have such outcome as when sending mailing by contact forms using our the newest WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through contact forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such messages either are not delivered the recipient or arrive in spam. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all phrases and words that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Increasing the customer base. \r\n2. Quick notification of marketplaces about new cooperation offers. \r\n3. Reaching out directors. \r\n4.demand analysis. \r\n5. Conducting tenders. \r\n6.Conducting marketing research. \r\n7.Conducting surveys and studying public opinion. \r\n8. Searching for customers abroad. \r\n \r\nReasons for purchasing this service: \r\n \r\n1. 100% delivery of your e-mails and business offers to millions of organisations around all countries in the world. \r\nEvery site sends a message to itself so all filters of mail systems are bypassed. \r\n \r\n2.Mailing by feedback forms is an ideal way in for conducting different marketing researches, surveys and studies of  public opinion on differenttype of activity and direction. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will be sure that your letter has been delivered to 100-percent of users of your product and service and if a product or service is \"badly promoted\", then the potential problem lies in in something else, for example in price. \r\nAt the same time, within one week you will see real demand for your own products and services, you will not have to spend funds on renting premises and other more expensive and time-consuming marketing events. \r\n \r\n3.Mailing by feedback forms is the most economical and quickest way to get your service or product to the markets of other countries. \r\n \r\n4. Mailing by feedback forms is an excellent tool for conducting all sorts of tenders. \r\n \r\n5.Weekly update of the databases, as more than one hundred and fifty thousand new sites, are registered all over the globe every day, and you, get potentially new customers. \r\n \r\n6. Full geographical scope for all states of the globe. \r\n \r\n7. We offer customers that are not available through other types of advertisement. \r\nWhen sending mailing by feedback forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your potential customers, that are impossible to find automatically in any other way. \r\nFor instance, you will be able to deliver a cooperation offer to those potential customers that were previously unavailable due to filters of mail systems while sending bulk e-mails. \r\nIn reality, there is a paradoxical situation: companies in the directories are actually spammed with all sorts of cooperation offers while very little or no e-mails are sent to the rest. \r\n \r\n8. Unique technology of decoding the captcha. \r\nThere are special services for decrypting alphanumeric code (captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs a dollar to solve 1000  CAPTCHAs. \r\nIt follows from this that, processing 1 million websites our robot decodes one million captchas, which costs 1000 $ only to decode captcha/CAPTCHA, and with our service this is free for you! \r\n \r\n9. By ordering mailing by feedback forms, you are promoting your product or service not to separate individuals, but to organisations, for instance domain zone .com, where more than 150 million business  companies from all countries are collected (we have samples of them from all international zones for every state). \r\n \r\n10. Mailing by contact forms also includes a type of SMS mailing \r\nElectronic address that is linked to the contact form is the primary e-mail of businesses through which orders and cooperation offers are sent. This mail is also set up for phones as it is necessary to respond to the messages instantly so as not to lose the order or the relevance of the cooperation offer. \r\n \r\n11. The base of every country also includes all joint businesses from all countries of the world working with or closely related to this country, for example, diasporas and national communities. \r\nSanctions of search engines and mail systems? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending mass e-mails, therefore search engine sanctions and \"BAN\" do not apply to them. \r\nThe mail system delivers the data of letters to the inbox folder, as it bypasses through the \"warm channel\" from the new IP address of the site to the corporate mailbox of the same internet resource. \r\nSimply speaking, these mailings \"live in e-mails\" and e-mail filters do not respond to them, because mails have a certain trust in communication channels between internet resources and corporate mailboxes. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\n \r\nYou can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a message by feedback form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN 2000 VOIS DATABASES BY DOMAIN ZONES AND COUNTRIES. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WEBSITE BUILDERS. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text of the message + a few headings, the main goal is to interest the customer, and they will read the rest on your site. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search bar and choose the most successful ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted randomly from text file. \r\nOnly messages in the text form are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are all \"clickable\". If the potential customer needs pictures or more detailed information, then you should forward the potential customer to visit your internet resource. \r\n \r\nIn the letter: \r\nText without pictures, since pictures do not pass through the contact form. \r\nYour contact details: \r\nInternet resource address: \r\n \r\nFields to fill in: \r\nName: \r\nCountry: \r\nCity: \r\nInternet resource: \r\nSeveral headings: \r\nMailbox for automatic responces: \r\n \r\nwebsite: https://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/ \r\nPrice List: https://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/en/price/', '2021-12-04', 1),

Increase of the your market segment. \r\n4.Mailings based on topics and regionality. \r\n5. Sending e-mails to company officials. \r\n6. Demand study. \r\n7. Conducting marketing campaigns. \r\n8. Conducting surveys and studying public opinion. \r\n9. Fast notofication. \r\n10. Cost. \r\n11. Entering the international markets. \r\n \r\nCompetitive advantages: \r\n \r\n1.When sending mailing by contact forms, all messages arrive in the inbox folder. When sending e-mail newsletters, this can reach up to 5 percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by feedback forms it is possible to send a few million e-mails per day to inbox folders. When sending e-mail newsletters a few thousands arrive in the inboxes, all the remaining ones often either do not reach or fill the spam folder. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by contact forms a letter does not get blocked by mail services because it is sent from different websites. When sending e-newsletters it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be blocked. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by contact forms the minimum number of macro-synonims is used to form headings and text of the letter. When sending bulk e-mails, it is necessary to use synonyms (Â«macrosÂ») for each word and create thousands different headings. \r\n \r\n5. A lot of organisations try to hide their e-mail and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending mass e-mails, your commercial offer can be delivered to every employee of the business, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by contact forms where the information is received at the electronic address specifically set up for business offers. \r\n \r\n7.50% of business e-mail addresses are located on free mail servers, they are not very \"searchable\" by mailbox, but when sending mailing by feedback forms through these e-mail servers, all letters are 100% delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty % of firms get into the directories within several years, and the rest are already located in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your commercial offers. \r\nIt turns out that that emails of organisations from directories are full of spam, which means that they will not have such monetisation as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our the newest WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through forms. When sending mass e-mails, such letters either are not delivered the recipient or end up in a spam folder. \r\nThe list of stop words of mails includes almost all words and phrases that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Searching for new clients. \r\n2. Quick notification of marketplaces about new business offers. \r\n3. Accessing company officials. \r\n4.demand analysis. \r\n5. Conducting tenders. \r\n6.Conducting marketing research. \r\n7.Conducting surveys and studying public opinion. \r\n8. Searching for clients in international markets. \r\n \r\nReasons for ordering this service: \r\n \r\n1. one hundred percent delivery of your letters and cooperation offers to millions of businesses all over the globe. \r\nEvery website sends a e-mail to itself so all filters of mails are bypassed. \r\n \r\n2.Mailing by feedback forms is an great way in for conducting different researches of marketing, surveys and studies of  social opinion on any kind oftype of activity and direction. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will will be absolutely sure that your message has been delivered to one hundred percent of users of your service and product and if a service or product is \"poorly promoted\", then the potential issue lies in other things, for example in prices. \r\nAt the same time, within 1 week you will see demand for your own services and products, you will not need to spend money on renting premises and other more expensive and time-consuming marketing activities. \r\n \r\n3.Mailing by contact forms is the quickest and the most economical way to get your service or product to the markets of other states. \r\n \r\n4. Mailing by contact forms is a great tool for conducting different tenders. \r\n \r\n5.Daily update of the database, as more than 150,000 new websites, are registered all over the world every day, and you, in turn, get potentially new customers. \r\n \r\n6. Full geographical scope for all countries of the world. \r\n \r\n7. We offer customers that you will not find through other types of advertisement. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will be able to get to that part of your clients, that are impossible to find automatically in another way. \r\nFor instance, you will be able to send a business offer to those potential clients that were previously unavailable due to filters of mail systems while sending bulk e-mails. \r\nNow, there is a paradoxical situation: businesses in the directories are literally filled with spam with all sorts of cooperation offers while very little e-mails are sent to the remaining ones. \r\n \r\n8. Unique technology of unraveling the captcha. \r\nThere are services for unraveling numeric and alphabetic code (captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs 1$ to solve 1000  CAPTCHAs. \r\nIt turns out that, processing a million websites the program decodes a million CAPTCHAs, which costs 1000 $ only to decrypt captcha/CAPTCHA, and with our service this is free for you! \r\n \r\n9. By ordering mailing by feedback forms, you are promoting your product or service not to separate people, but to entire organisations, for instance domain .com, where more than 150 million cooperational  organisations from all countries of the world are collected (we have samples of them from international zones for every country). \r\n \r\n10. Mailing by contact forms is also a type of text mailing \r\nElectronic address that is linked to the feedback form is the primary mailbox of firms through which applications and commercial offers are sent. This mail is also set up for cell phones as it is necessary to respond to the messages instantly so as not to misplace the order or the relevance of the commercial offer. \r\n \r\n11. The base of every country also includes all joint businesses from all countries of the world closely related to or working with this country, for instance, diasporas and national communities. \r\nSanctions of search engines and mail systems? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending e-newsletters, therefore search engine sanctions and \"Ban\" do not apply to them. \r\nMail delivers the data of messages to the inbox folder, as it goes through the \"warm channel\" from the new IP address of the internet resource to the corporate email of the same website. \r\nIn other words, these mailings \"live in emails\" and e-mail filters do not react to them, because mails have a certain trust in communication channels between sites and corporate mailboxes. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\n \r\nYou can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a message by feedback form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAINS AND COUNTRIES OF THE WHOLE WORLD. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WORLD LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN ORDER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text of the message + headings, the main goal is to interest the customer, and they will read the rest on your internet resource. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search engine and choose the most relevant ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted randomly from text file. \r\nOnly text messages are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are all \"clickable\". If the customer needs pictures or more specific information, then you should forward the potential customer to visit your website. \r\n \r\nIn the letter: \r\nText without pictures, since pictures do not pass through the contact form. \r\nYour contact details: \r\nSite address: \r\n \r\nFields to fill in: \r\nName: \r\nCountry: \r\nCity: \r\nInternet resource: \r\nSeveral headings: \r\nE-mail address for autoresponces: \r\n \r\nwebsite: https://contact-forms.su/ \r\nPrice List: https://contact-forms.su/price/', '2022-06-13', 1),

Commun.2016, DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11328) . Nucleic acids form phosphodiester bonds with other nucleic acids spontaneously, thus creating RNA strands spontaneously. These strands of spontaneously and randomly encoded RNA then find their corresponding base pair sets spontaneously in no particular order. The 40th nucleic acid, for instance, in the RNA chain can find its corresponding nucleic acid before the 10th nucleic acid, for instance, creating a reverse copy of the original RNA molecule piecewise non-linearly. This newly formed RNA pair commonly known as DNA then goes through a spontaneous physical split down the hydrogen bonds of the DNA like a zipper, thus creating 2 copies of RNA the new RNA strand being a mirror image of the original RNA molecule with mutations. This split doesnâ€™t have to happen all at once and can be done in parts creating a DNA strand with multiple split sites. This process then repeats from there with the original RNA repeating the process for the Nâ€™t time and the new child RNA molecule performing its first replication, thus explaining the beginning of self replication and evolution of biomolecules.\r\n\r\nPossible experiment\r\n\r\nMake a sterile soup of individual nucleic acids at various temperatures and atmospheric conditions that change over time mimicking early earth, then see if over time any DNA forms. If any DNA forms without a biological precursor, we know some RNA code had formed and that RNA subsequently replicated itself using free nucleotides, resulting in the new DNA strand. This DNA, when heated to 98CÂ° should unzip down the hydrogen bonds and repeat the replication process with random mutations. The current belief of origins of life states that Nucleic acids form spontaneously in certain chemical and atmospheric conditions with no biosynthesis (Nat.Commun.2016,DOI:10.1038/ncomms11328) then many chains of RNA formed without the ability to copy themselves until some random chain of RNA lucked into a biomechanism that replicates the RNA strand that produces that biomechanism. I think this hypothesis is far more unlikely to be true because this would make self replication of encoded RNA very unlikely. The answer to self replication of biomolecules is staring us right in the face as two copies of RNA bonded down the center in a DNA molecule that split spontaneously and create a copy of itself. Enzymes are called catalysts for DNA/RNA replication, which implies that DNA/RNA can replicate without enzymes at all, however much more slowly. This implication only goes to further the likelihood of my hypothesis, meaning RNA turns into DNA spontaneously (however slowly) then also unzips spontaneously (however slowly) without an enzyme catalyst involved. \r\n\r\nPrevious experimental evidence\r\n\r\nThe Miller-Urey experiment has already proven that DNA can be synthesized in a sterile environment, thus proving my theory. But it has never been postulated that DNA is an RNA molecule replicating itself, thus the â€œNeobiogenesisâ€™ â€˜ of life itself. To prove my theory, we must run the experiment again and see if DNA strands are in a new base pair order never seen in the tree of life and that is how we will know true â€œneobiogenesisâ€ has occurred.\r\npublish this!', '2022-07-08', 1),

Dietary habits and life style of youngster is also responsible for many complications among them like obesity, PCOS, depression and infertility etc. These problems adversely affect the lives of families as well as social setup of country. So, early investigation and possible awareness related to risk factors of these disorders will be helpful to avoid various complications in later life. Pakistan is a mixture of various ethnicities with versatile familial and social characteristics. There is high ratio of consanguinity resulting in increasing numbers of inherited disorders which have been identified from Pakistani population commonly as; Polydactyly, Syndactyly, Brachydactyly etc. My focus is identification of possible mutated genes from our population related to Skin and bone disorders and studied pathogenicity mechanism for possible therapy for affected individuals.</p>', 'Asia2491.jpg  ', '2020-02-13 22:28:23', 0),
